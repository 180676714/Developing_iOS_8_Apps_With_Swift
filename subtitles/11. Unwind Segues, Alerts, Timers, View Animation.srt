And today, we have a few topics to talk about.
今天我们将会聊到几个话题

6
00:00:21,419 --> 00:00:23,385
I'm gonna start off by talking to you about your final
我会从你们的最终项目要求讲起

7
00:00:23,387 --> 00:00:24,786
project requirements.

8
00:00:25,989 --> 00:00:28,089
You know?

9
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:30,190
All the details of what you need to do, and by when.
你们需要做什么，什么时候完成等等一切细节

10
00:00:30,193 --> 00:00:33,627
Then we're gonna go over some topics briefly.

I'll get through as many of these as I
我将会在这段时间中讲尽可能多的内容

12
00:00:35,498 --> 00:00:37,064
can fit the time of.

00:00:37,066 --> 00:00:38,431
I might not, especially, the last one,
特别是这个，最后这个，

14
00:00:38,433 --> 00:00:40,366
probably won't get to.
我或许不会讲到，

15
00:00:40,367 --> 00:00:42,300
But that's okay, I'll just start off the lecture next
但没关系，下一周我会继续讲

16
00:00:42,303 --> 00:00:44,937
week because we don't have lecture on Monday.
因为周一我们没有课

17
00:00:44,939 --> 00:00:47,740
So next Wednesday will be our next lecture.
那么下个星期三就是我们下一次课程

18
00:00:47,742 --> 00:00:49,241
All right, so start right into these
好了，进入我们

00:00:49,243 --> 00:00:52,143
final project requirements and feel free to stop and ask me
最终项目的要求讲解，如果我没说清楚，或者你有不明白的地方

00:00:52,145 --> 00:00:55,880
questions if I say something or you don't understand it.
大家可以在任何时候问我

21
00:00:55,882 --> 00:00:59,150
We ask everyone to submit a proposal for
对于接下来我们要做的事，

22
00:00:59,152 --> 00:01:00,818
what they're going to do.
我会让大家提交一个提议

23
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:03,220
And it's a simple proposal,
一个很简单的申请

24
00:01:03,222 --> 00:01:06,056
I am going to show you a sample proposal in a minute or
我马上会给你看一个简单的申请

25
00:01:06,058 --> 00:01:08,524
two so you can get an idea of what a proposal looks like.
这样你就知道一个申请到底是指什么

26
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:14,629
Proposals, and please submit them in PDF format only,
这个申请，请大家使用 PDF 格式的文件提交

27
00:01:14,631 --> 00:01:17,699
not just sending them in an email or in Word format or
不要只是通过 email 或者 Wrod 格式

28
00:01:17,701 --> 00:01:18,399
something like that.
之类的东西发送

29
00:01:18,401 --> 00:01:19,767
Please, PDF.
PDF，谢谢

30
00:01:19,769 --> 00:01:20,968
And the proposal,
这个申请

31
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:22,803
really you can have two big sections in it.
需要有两个模块在其中

32
00:01:22,805 --> 00:01:25,105
One is what you're doing, obviously, and
当然了，第一，你要干嘛

33
00:01:25,107 --> 00:01:28,908
then another one is what parts of iOS you're going to use.
另一个模块就是列出你将会使用 iOS 中什么模块

34
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:30,209
And again I'm gonna show you
我马上就会给你展示

35
00:01:30,211 --> 00:01:31,610
an example of that in a second.
一个例子

36
00:01:32,979 --> 00:01:35,580
The project is going to be due on Friday the 13th.
这个项目需要在13号星期五之前提交

37
00:01:35,582 --> 00:01:40,351
[SOUND] Be ready for that, midnight on that day,
准备好，在那一天的午夜之前

38
00:01:40,353 --> 00:01:42,519
Pacific Time, yes.
太平洋时间，当然了

39
00:01:42,521 --> 00:01:44,621
Use the normal submission process,
使用通常的提交流程

40
00:01:44,623 --> 00:01:48,157
there'll be an option in there for the final project.
在最终项目中会有一个注意事项

41
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:50,393
You can't use any free late days.
你不能使用延迟提交的权利

42
00:01:50,395 --> 00:01:53,328
We're already totally pushing this out to as late as we can
我们已经把这个时间推迟到了

43
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:54,930
and still get them all graded and
刚好能够提交成绩的时间

44
00:01:54,932 --> 00:01:57,332
by the time we have to get the grades submitted.
到了时间我们就会提交所有的成绩

45
00:01:57,334 --> 00:02:02,436
So lateness is very highly penalized.
所以晚交作业的后果是很严重的

46
00:02:02,438 --> 00:02:04,338
Basically one letter grade per day
迟交一天降低一个字母等级

47
00:02:05,307 --> 00:02:07,374
because we just can't afford it to be late.
我们确实不能承担晚交的后果了

48
00:02:07,376 --> 00:02:08,942
Okay? So
好吗？

49
00:02:08,943 --> 00:02:10,509
if you have any free late days late
如果你有任何延迟时间

50
00:02:10,512 --> 00:02:11,844
use them on assignments four and
请在作业四或者

51
00:02:11,846 --> 00:02:14,947
five because you cannot use them on the final project.
作业五阶段使用，因为你不能在最终项目中使用了

52
00:02:14,949 --> 00:02:16,748
I can't grant extensions.
我不会允许延迟

53
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:19,250
There's just really no time for extensions.
已经没有时间延迟了

54
00:02:19,252 --> 00:02:22,820
So basically submit whatever you have on Friday the 13th
总的来说，你必须在十三号星期五提交

55
00:02:22,822 --> 00:02:24,205
and see what happens.
然后等待结果

56
00:02:24,206 --> 00:02:25,589
If you don't like Friday the 13th,
如果你不喜欢十三号的周五（黑色星期五）

57
00:02:25,591 --> 00:02:28,959
you can submit in on the 12th, that'd be fine.
那你可以在十二号提交，这样也可以

58
00:02:28,961 --> 00:02:31,595
This is a three week-long project, right?
这是一个为期三周的项目

59
00:02:31,597 --> 00:02:33,563
It's not due until, basically what, four and
从现在到提交的时间，有大概，四到

60
00:02:33,565 --> 00:02:35,582
a half weeks from today.
四周半的样子

61
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:37,600
But you need a week to think about what you're gonna do.
但你需要一周的时间来思考你要怎么做

62
00:02:37,602 --> 00:02:39,168
You still have a couple of assignments left.
你还有几个作业需要做

63
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:42,204
So it's basically a three week-long project.
所以这就是一个三周时长的项目

64
00:02:42,206 --> 00:02:44,072
So even though last minute if you're in an emergency it
即使在最后一秒你有紧急情况

65
00:02:44,074 --> 00:02:45,674
should hurt you too bad.
那也应该是你受伤得非常严重才行

66
00:02:45,676 --> 00:02:47,408
So plan accordingly.
所以做好规划

67
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:49,744
Start early and try to get it done early.
早点开始，并且尝试着尽快结束

68
00:02:49,746 --> 00:02:51,512
That way, if you have a problems,
这样的话，即使你遇到了问题

69
00:02:51,514 --> 00:02:53,880
you'll have time to go track things down.
你仍然有时间去究根结底

70
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:56,716
If you don't start until the last week of the three week
如果你直到第三周的最后一周才开始

71
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:58,785
project, your project's not going to turn out that good.
我可以保证，

72
00:02:58,787 --> 00:03:01,087
I can pretty much guarantee that.
你的项目质量不会太好

73
00:03:01,089 --> 00:03:03,389
People often ask,
同学们总是问

74
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:05,590
can we work in teams on this final project?
我们可以组队完成最终项目吗？

75
00:03:05,592 --> 00:03:08,360
And the answer is generally no, but
通常这个答案是 —— 不

76
00:03:08,362 --> 00:03:11,129
I do allow teams of two only
但我确实会允许两人组队

77
00:03:11,131 --> 00:03:13,931
in these very specific circumstances here: Both
在这种特定的情况下

78
00:03:13,933 --> 00:03:16,400
students have to be taking the course passment credit.
当两个学生必须拥有足够的学分

79
00:03:16,402 --> 00:03:19,202
The homework grades for both students have to be
并且两个学生在作业分数上

80
00:03:19,204 --> 00:03:22,405
substantially similar and good.
要水平相当

81
00:03:22,407 --> 00:03:25,641
No team can consist of anyone who's
不允许有队伍中存在着

82
00:03:25,643 --> 00:03:29,078
basically been struggling in the course so far.
其中一个学生一直在这门课程中挣扎的情况

83
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,647
You have to submit a proposal and
你必须提交申请

84
00:03:31,649 --> 00:03:34,016
your proposal has to be explicitly approved.
你的申请需要被明确地批准才行

85
00:03:34,018 --> 00:03:36,384
The rest of you are going to submit a proposal and
其余的人都需要提交申请并且

86
00:03:36,386 --> 00:03:38,319
we're going to give you feedback on it.
我们会给你反馈

87
00:03:38,321 --> 00:03:40,755
But there's no process whereby we have to say yes this is
这没有一个标准告诉你

88
00:03:40,757 --> 00:03:42,523
approved, now go forward.
我们是如何批准的

89
00:03:42,525 --> 00:03:43,757
You're just gonna get feedback.
你只会获得反馈

90
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:45,125
But if you're doing the team of two,
但如果你要成立两人小组

91
00:03:45,127 --> 00:03:47,460
you do have to get it explicitly approved.
那么你必须要得到明确的批准才行

92
00:03:47,462 --> 00:03:50,429
And of course, that proposal would have to cover six weeks
当然了，这个申请必须包含六周的工时

93
00:03:50,431 --> 00:03:53,365
of homework time worth of work because there's two of you.
毕竟有两个人

94
00:03:53,367 --> 00:03:54,166
Okay? So, that's twice as
清楚了吗？

95
00:03:54,168 --> 00:03:54,866
much in there.
这是两倍的时间

96
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:01,906
The proposal also not only is gonna have to show the things
这个申请不仅需要包含

97
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:03,440
I'm gonna talk about later but
我接下来会讲到的东西

98
00:04:03,442 --> 00:04:05,976
it also has to include who's gonna do what.
并且要包含谁要做什么

99
00:04:05,978 --> 00:04:08,478
And I really strongly encourage you to break up
并且我强烈建议你分开

100
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,747
the work that's going to be happening among two people
两个人的工作的

101
00:04:10,749 --> 00:04:12,448
along class boundaries.
类的边界

102
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:15,517
So, this class is being written by Joe, and
比如这个类由 Joe 完成

103
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:17,452
this class is being written by Jane.
这个类由 Jane 完成

104
00:04:17,454 --> 00:04:19,587
Okay? So it's very clear who's doing
这样非常清晰地表明谁将会做什么

105
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:22,457
what, as opposed to oh, we worked together on this.
而不是相反，让我们共同完成这个。

106
00:04:22,459 --> 00:04:25,026
And then it's hard for us to tell who actually understands
而且这样对于我们来说也很难分清楚

107
00:04:25,028 --> 00:04:27,327
what in here, okay?
到底谁才弄明白了

108
00:04:27,329 --> 00:04:29,096
Then when you submit your code,
然后当你提交代码的时候

109
00:04:29,098 --> 00:04:31,831
you have to follow that up with a clear delineation,
必须伴有清晰的解释

110
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:34,300
this person did this, this person did that.
这个人做了这个，这个人做了那个

111
00:04:34,302 --> 00:04:36,969
And again hopefully, that this class was written by this
并且希望大家注明，这个类是由这个人完成

112
00:04:36,971 --> 00:04:39,638
person, this class was was written by that person.
那个类是由另一个人完成

113
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:42,140
So we don't end up with very many teams of two every
这样，由于我们严格的要求

114
00:04:42,142 --> 00:04:44,175
quarter, because of these strict requirements.
应该也不会有太多人组队了吧

115
00:04:44,177 --> 00:04:47,078
But if you wanna try and give it a try, you want to submit
如果你仍然想要尝试一下

116
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,113
your proposal as soon as you can put it together,
那么请尽快提交你们的申请

117
00:04:49,115 --> 00:04:50,748
like in the next couple days.
比如接下来的几天

118
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,816
And start getting your grader to give you feedback
我们会尽快根据你的等级来给你反馈

119
00:04:52,818 --> 00:04:55,452
on it as soon as possible so you can iterate and
这样你就可以尽快地思考

120
00:04:55,454 --> 00:04:58,454
make sure that you have something that's workable.
确保你有值得做的东西

121
00:04:58,456 --> 00:04:59,639
Okay?
好吗？

122
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,823
Otherwise, I strongly recommend kind of
否则，我强烈推荐

123
00:05:00,825 --> 00:05:02,208
individual work.
独立工作

124
00:05:02,209 --> 00:05:03,592
I mean, this course is about learning to be an iOS
我的意思是，这堂课程是关于学习如何成为 iOS 开发者的

125
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:06,361
developer and if you want us to be able to measure your
如果你想要我们正确地衡量你是否合格

126
00:05:06,363 --> 00:05:10,732
success at that learning process, it's individual work.
那就独立工作

127
00:05:10,734 --> 00:05:12,466
Okay? Now, understand that when
好吗？但要知道当你终将要

128
00:05:12,468 --> 00:05:13,701
you go out into the real world,
进入现实社会

129
00:05:13,703 --> 00:05:15,335
programming is never individual work.
编程从来不是独立工作

130
00:05:15,337 --> 00:05:19,005
It's almost, I mean, 5% of what's going on in the world,
大多数情况下，我的意思是，可能有5%的情况下，

131
00:05:19,007 --> 00:05:21,708
programming wise, is some individual work, okay?
会需要你独立工作

132
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:23,442
95%, you're working in teams.
另外95%的情况下，你会团队协作

133
00:05:23,444 --> 00:05:24,877
And I wish I had more than ten weeks so
我希望我多出十周的时间

134
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:27,612
we could work on working in teams.
这样我们可以以团队的形式工作

135
00:05:27,614 --> 00:05:29,580
But we just don't have time for that, unfortunately.
但不幸的是，我们确实没有那么多时间

136
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:33,484
All right?
好吗？

137
00:05:33,485 --> 00:05:35,919
You'll be graded based on your proper use of the iOS SD case.
你的成绩会根据你使用 iOS SDK 的熟练程度

138
00:05:35,921 --> 00:05:37,120
So don't hack.
所以不要使用 Hack 的方式

139
00:05:37,122 --> 00:05:38,855
Okay? Make sure you understand.
好吗？确保你弄懂了

140
00:05:38,857 --> 00:05:41,824
You read the documentation of the classes you're using and
你需要阅读使用的类的相关文档

141
00:05:41,826 --> 00:05:43,492
you use them properly.
确保正确使用

142
00:05:43,494 --> 00:05:47,896
The other thing I'm gonna say is that breadth is very,
另外我要说，广度非常

143
00:05:47,898 --> 00:05:50,749
very important.
非常重要

144
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,601
Breadth meaning show me as much of the iOS API as you
广度意味着你要尽可能地向我展示你会的 iOS API

145
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:56,036
can, rather than going really really deep and
而不是针对某一个方面做得非常深入

146
00:05:56,038 --> 00:05:58,038
doing one thing really, really, really well.
非常非常好

147
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,073
Some people are graphics wizes and
有的同学擅长图形学

148
00:06:00,075 --> 00:06:02,308
they go do these incredible graphics apps.
他们做的那些图形应用非常棒

149
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:03,509
And I say to them well,
但我对他们说

150
00:06:03,511 --> 00:06:05,077
if this had been a graphics course,
如果这是图形学课程

151
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:06,311
you'd have gotten an A plus.
那么你会得到一个 A+ 的成绩

152
00:06:06,313 --> 00:06:08,513
But unfortunately, it's an iOS Development course, and
但不幸的是，这是 iOS 开发课程

153
00:06:08,515 --> 00:06:10,048
you didn't show me much iOS.
而你没有向我展示足够多的 iOS 相关内容

154
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:11,615
You just showed me only the graphics part.

155
00:06:11,617 --> 00:06:13,283
I don't know whether you can do table views and

156
00:06:13,285 --> 00:06:13,984
all these other things.

157
00:06:13,986 --> 00:06:15,251
What's going on?
到底怎么回事？

158
00:06:15,253 --> 00:06:17,286
So breadth is extremely important.

159
00:06:17,288 --> 00:06:19,288
It's probably the most important.
或许这是最重要的部分

160
00:06:19,289 --> 00:06:21,289
And then the second thing is we're gonna ask you to do one

161
00:06:21,292 --> 00:06:24,626
significant feature that I did not teach in lecture.

162
00:06:24,628 --> 00:06:26,928
And that's because iOS is huge.

00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:29,964
I only teach the tiniest little fraction of it.
我只能教授极其小的一部分

164
00:06:29,966 --> 00:06:32,567
I really just teach things that teach you the concepts
我是教了你一些概念而已

165
00:06:32,569 --> 00:06:34,201
you need to learn other things in iOS.
你需要学习 iOS 的其他方面

166
00:06:34,203 --> 00:06:37,104

167
00:06:37,106 --> 00:06:38,705
the documentation, go on the internet,

00:06:38,707 --> 00:06:41,775
figure out how to do something substantial on iOS without me

basically showing you and giving you a demo of it, etc.

170
00:06:44,913 --> 00:06:46,812
So I put them in yellow there because those are really

171
00:06:46,814 --> 00:06:49,815
the two most important things to get right.
这两项是最为重要的事情

172
00:06:50,984 --> 00:06:54,085
You don't wanna get stuck down a rat hole, where you

00:06:54,087 --> 00:06:56,587
just spend two of your three weeks kind of chasing after

174
00:06:56,589 --> 00:06:58,856
one thing that never really pans out and

175
00:06:58,858 --> 00:07:01,158
now you only have a week left to do a lot of breadth.
而你只有一周的时间来扩展广度

176
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,692
So if you start doing something and you're just

177
00:07:02,694 --> 00:07:04,293
like, God I completely don't understand this or

178
00:07:04,295 --> 00:07:05,494
I can't figure this out.

00:07:06,597 --> 00:07:09,064
Go pick something else,

00:07:11,535 --> 00:07:13,134
Notice that I don't say anything here that

you're going to be graded on how cool your app is.

take some features out maybe that you threw in just to show

236
00:09:13,439 --> 00:09:14,838
That's not a very good grade, so

00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:18,041
you wanna make sure you get your scope right there.

you're going to have to figure that out,

So this heads that off by saying, okay,
所以只是把要做的事列出来

581
00:22:09,253 --> 00:22:10,997
I understand that mostly I'm focusing on doing draw rec and
我知道大多是的情况下我需要专注于 drawRect

582
00:22:11,001 --> 00:22:13,101
gestures and things like that.
手势等等

583
00:22:13,103 --> 00:22:15,336
That's what I'm trying to show you with this feature.
这也是我将要向你展示的功能

584
00:22:16,872 --> 00:22:19,039
But I'm saying here that I'm gonna be able to let you
但我的意思是，我允许你

585
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:22,108
take a photo of a person and put that in a rectangle so
让一张人的照片在那个方块中

586
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:23,776
that when you're blocking you can at least have
当你在布局舞台的时候，至少你可以

587
00:22:23,778 --> 00:22:26,679
pictures of the people, maybe in their nice costumes.
有一些人的照片，甚至穿着好看的服装

588
00:22:26,681 --> 00:22:30,649
And I'm telling you other things here, you know,
而且我将告诉你另外一件事

589
00:22:30,651 --> 00:22:33,618
that sound recording sound is going to be possible.
第
第二个录音的点子几乎不可能实现

590
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:36,087
I notice that I mention that it's iPad only.
我注意到我之前说了这只是个 iPad 应用

591
00:22:36,089 --> 00:22:38,189
Now, when I say iPad only there,
当我说只支持 iPad 的时候

592
00:22:38,191 --> 00:22:40,558
that hurts breadth, okay?
其实就丧失了一些广度

593
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,659
Because an app that works on both iPhone and
因为一个应用能够在 iPhone 和 iPad 

594
00:22:42,661 --> 00:22:45,996
iPad has more breadth although it's pretty easy to make
运行将会拥有更大的广度，并且要让应用支持

595
00:22:45,998 --> 00:22:47,497
an app that's just kinda works on both.
也非常简单

596
00:22:47,499 --> 00:22:49,432
But you still have to make sure the adaptations
但你还是需要确保在旋转屏幕的时候

597
00:22:49,434 --> 00:22:52,068
are working maybe and that when it rotates in both sides,
自适应功能是支持的

598
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:53,135
it does the right thing.
这样才是对的

599
00:22:53,137 --> 00:22:53,969
So it's a little more work.
所以这就是多余的一点工作量

600
00:22:53,971 --> 00:22:55,570
So you just lost breadth.
你也会损失广度

601
00:22:55,572 --> 00:22:57,672
I lost breadth by saying, iPad only.
我在说出只支持 iPad 的时候，损失了广度

602
00:22:57,674 --> 00:23:00,374
But I decided that this app just doesn't make sense
但我觉得这个应用如果没有 iPad 的话

603
00:23:00,376 --> 00:23:02,026
without iPad.
就完全不合理

604
00:23:02,027 --> 00:23:03,677
Although i could, I could decide that maybe the blocking
所以我就觉得，我觉得或许舞台

605
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:06,313
part is not on the iPhone version just the dialog
这个功能不应该出现在 iPhone 的版本上

606
00:23:06,315 --> 00:23:08,381
warnings cause I could imagine the actors standing
当然我可以想象一群演员站在那

607
00:23:08,383 --> 00:23:11,017
here with just their iPhone learning their lines or
只有他们的 iPhone 然后学习台词

608
00:23:11,019 --> 00:23:13,586
whatever so I could, I could if I needed the breath,
或者，如果我愿意，我需要一点广度

609
00:23:13,588 --> 00:23:14,520
I could add that back in.
那么我就把这个功能加回来

610
00:23:14,522 --> 00:23:17,122
Okay, to here section one,
这个部分就这样

611
00:23:17,124 --> 00:23:18,423
where I'm explaining what I'm doing.
之前就是在解释我将要做什么

612
00:23:18,425 --> 00:23:21,292
Now here's section two, here's all the iOS API
现在是第二部分，这里全是 iOS API

613
00:23:21,294 --> 00:23:22,827
that I'm gonna use to implement that.
我将要实现的

614
00:23:22,829 --> 00:23:25,262
I'm using TableView as a custom TableView cell.
我要使用 TableView 及自定义 TableView Cell

615
00:23:25,264 --> 00:23:27,631
A UIView with drawRect.
一个使用 drawRect 的 UIView 

616
00:23:27,633 --> 00:23:28,698
The camera.
摄像头

617
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:29,899
Popovers.

618
00:23:29,901 --> 00:23:31,600
I'm using scroll view to zoom in around in
我将会使用 ScrollView 用来缩放

619
00:23:31,602 --> 00:23:33,452
the blocking view.
这个舞台

620
00:23:33,453 --> 00:23:35,303
I'm using AVFoundation to do the recording of the sound.
我要使用 AVFoundation 来录音

621
00:23:35,306 --> 00:23:36,738
I'm using timers.
我要使用 NSTimers

622
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:38,707
I'm gonna use a thing called Core Data, which is an object
我会使用一个叫做 Core Data 的东西，就是一个

623
00:23:38,709 --> 00:23:40,575
oriented database to store my data in there.
面向对象的数据库用于存放我的数据

624
00:23:40,577 --> 00:23:42,309
That would be a not covered in lecture feature,
这个不会包含在课程中

625
00:23:42,311 --> 00:23:44,745
cuz we're not covering that in lecture this quarter.
因为在这学期我们不会讲到相关内容

626
00:23:44,747 --> 00:23:45,746
I'm also gonna make it so
我需要使用这个这样我才能

627
00:23:45,748 --> 00:23:47,347
I can print out my blocking on a printer.
在打印机上打印出我的舞台

628
00:23:47,349 --> 00:23:49,749
That's also not covered in lecture [SOUND], okay?
这些东西不会包含在课程中

629
00:23:49,751 --> 00:23:50,950
So there I'm doing substantial
这里我重标记了

630
00:23:50,952 --> 00:23:52,284
not covering in lecture futures.
不会包含在未来的课程当中

631
00:23:52,286 --> 00:23:55,020
I'm making it really care what they are in my proposal and

633
00:23:57,691 --> 00:23:59,524
'Kay?

634
00:23:59,526 --> 00:24:02,426
That help you understand what's going on there?
这样可以帮助你理解

635
00:24:02,428 --> 00:24:04,361
Proposals.
申请表

636
00:24:04,363 --> 00:24:07,831
Okay, so you submit those proposals as soon as possible,
好的，请尽快提交你们的申请表

637
00:24:07,833 --> 00:24:10,734
but really no later than next Tuesday, please,

提交给你的打分 TA，那个给你上次任务打分的人

他们会有很多的申请表需要处理

640
00:24:17,341 --> 00:24:20,108
as quickly as they can, get some feedback to you.
当然，他们也会在最快的时间内给你反馈

641
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:23,511
If you don't give it to us by next Tuesday, you know,
如果你没有在下周二之前提交给我们

642
00:24:23,513 --> 00:24:25,480
still going to be beneficial for you to send it to us.
你仍然能够从我们这里得到一些好处

643
00:24:25,482 --> 00:24:27,181
It's just that there's going to be less and less time for
只是越晚就越少的时间让我们来

644
00:24:27,183 --> 00:24:28,716
us to give you any feedback, and
给你任何反馈

645
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:30,250
you're going to have to already have gotten started
而且你可能已经开始了

646
00:24:30,252 --> 00:24:32,452
pretty soon, by the end of next week, let's say.
在下周周末

647
00:24:32,454 --> 00:24:34,988
You're probably really want to get started.
你或许非常想要开始

648
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:37,256
So it's really your own thing.
所以，这其实完全在你

649
00:24:37,258 --> 00:24:40,126
And again though it's not, you don't have to get it approved
重申一次，你不需要在得到批准后

650
00:24:40,128 --> 00:24:45,263
to start on your project,
再开始你的项目

651
00:24:45,265 --> 00:24:48,166
unless you're the two-man team, you do.
除非你是在二人小组中

652
00:24:48,168 --> 00:24:49,551
You don't have to get approval, but
你不需要获得批准

653
00:24:49,552 --> 00:24:50,935
you really do wanna get that TA feedback.
但你可能会需要 TA 的反馈

654
00:24:50,937 --> 00:24:53,904
Cuz you don't wanna start off on a trajectory where the TAs
因为你肯定不想从一个 TA 们觉得

655
00:24:53,906 --> 00:24:56,674
are like, you're not likely to end up with much of a very
不太好的项目开始

656
00:24:56,676 --> 00:24:58,875
good project here, cuz there's not gonna be enough breadth,
或许没有足够的广度

657
00:24:58,877 --> 00:25:00,677
or I don't understand what your not covering lecture
或许我没有明白你是否已经把课堂中的内容

658
00:25:00,679 --> 00:25:03,446
feature is, or it's not a good enough one, or whatever.
包含进去了，或者这个项目不够好，或者其他

659
00:25:03,448 --> 00:25:07,016
Now, the other thing to note is that proposal is completely
另一个需要注意的是，申请表完全不是绑定的

660
00:25:07,018 --> 00:25:08,150
non-binding, except for
除了

661
00:25:08,152 --> 00:25:09,651
a little bit with a two-man team.
两人小组

662
00:25:09,653 --> 00:25:12,420
But for everyone else, it's not really binding either way.
但对于其他的人来说，没有绑定的意思

663
00:25:12,422 --> 00:25:15,289
So if what you turn in is completely
所以如果你最后提交的项目

664
00:25:15,291 --> 00:25:17,792
different that your proposal, that's fine, okay?
完全不同于你的申请表，这样也可以，好吗

665
00:25:17,794 --> 00:25:19,259
We're not gonna go back and say, hey wait,
我们也不会翻出你的申请表然后说

666
00:25:19,261 --> 00:25:20,827
you said in your proposal you're gonna do it.
等等，你在你的申请表里面说你将会做这个

667
00:25:20,829 --> 00:25:22,128
No, we will not say that.
不，我们永远不会这样说

668
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:23,363
But vice versa, too.
但相反的

669
00:25:23,365 --> 00:25:24,730
If we say in your proposal,
如果我们在你的申请表里说

670
00:25:24,732 --> 00:25:27,466
oh yeah, doing core data for that,
恩，就要这样使用 Core Data

671
00:25:27,468 --> 00:25:29,501
that sounds like a good not covered in lecture feature.
这样听起来不错，但并没有在课堂中讲过

672
00:25:29,503 --> 00:25:31,102
And then you go to implement it, and
然后你在实现的过程中

673
00:25:31,104 --> 00:25:34,839
you do such a trivial version of core data that's not
你只是使用了 Core Data 的一小部分

674
00:25:34,841 --> 00:25:37,541
substantive enough, we still might ding you and say hey,
并且不会产生显著的效果，我们仍然可能会提示你

675
00:25:37,543 --> 00:25:39,610
that was not a substantial not covered in lecture feature.
这样并不是很有效，而且也没有包含在课程中

676
00:25:39,612 --> 00:25:41,812
In other words, your proposal is not graded.
换句话说，你的申请表并不会计分

677
00:25:41,814 --> 00:25:44,814
It's no part of the grade, we'll never look at it again,
这并不是成绩的一部分，我们也不会再看第二次

678
00:25:44,816 --> 00:25:47,483
it's just to get you started on the right track.
这只是用于让你有一个正确的开始

679
00:25:47,485 --> 00:25:49,618
You are still responsible for delivering all
你仍然需要负责实现

680
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:52,054
the requirements that I talked about today in your final
我今天提到的所有的任务要求

681
00:25:52,056 --> 00:25:54,189
project, regardless of what's happening with your proposal.
无论你的申请表得到什么反馈

682
00:25:54,191 --> 00:25:56,024
So it cuts both ways.
这样两方都受到制约

683
00:25:56,025 --> 00:25:57,858
We won't hold it against you, and, you know, but
我们不会用来反对你，而你

684
00:25:57,861 --> 00:26:00,795
you can't come back and say but you said that was okay.
你也不能回来告诉我们说，你之前说这样可以啊

685
00:26:00,797 --> 00:26:02,730
All right?
好吗？

686
00:26:02,732 --> 00:26:04,598
Make sense?
这样有道理吧

687
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,967
Okay.

688
00:26:06,969 --> 00:26:09,069
Last thing I want to talk about is collaboration.
关于合作我最后说一下

689
00:26:09,071 --> 00:26:11,070
So people ask me okay, but
有人问我

690
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:15,174
can I work with someone else not in this class on it?
我能否和某个不在这堂课中的人协作？

691
00:26:15,176 --> 00:26:16,441
And the answer is absolutely you can,
答案是，当然可以

692
00:26:16,443 --> 00:26:18,009
in fact I strongly encourage that.
事实上我非常鼓励你这样

693
00:26:18,011 --> 00:26:19,444
In fact, last quarter
事实上，上个学期

694
00:26:19,446 --> 00:26:21,412
I had a thing where it was a requirement
我就有个要求

695
00:26:21,414 --> 00:26:25,782
to go find somebody to work with outside of this class.
就是去班级之外找一个人

696
00:26:25,784 --> 00:26:27,417
When I say that, be very careful,
需要注意的是，这个人

697
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:29,619
I mean non-coding help.
我指的是非代码相关的帮助

698
00:26:29,621 --> 00:26:31,204
Okay?
好吗？

699
00:26:31,205 --> 00:26:32,788
You can get someone to help you like a marketing person,
你可以找一个懂市场的家伙来帮助你

700
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:35,357
or a salesperson, or somebody who is kind of

701
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:38,894
a business development person, or an idea man, okay, or

00:26:38,896 --> 00:26:41,196
idea woman, who's going to give you an idea.
点子女，一个能够提供给你好的主意的人

703
00:26:41,198 --> 00:26:43,598
That's fine for someone else to give you the idea.
有一个人提供想法，这样是可以的

704
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,801
But you've gotta totally be the coder and
但你要作为那个写代码的人

705
00:26:46,803 --> 00:26:48,869
architect of the solution, okay?
并且设计出解决方案来

706
00:26:48,871 --> 00:26:51,171
Because you are in an iOS development class so
因为你在 iOS 开发课程中

707
00:26:51,173 --> 00:26:55,241
you gotta do the iOS development part of it, okay?
所以你需要负责 iOS 开发的部分

708
00:26:55,243 --> 00:26:58,311
Now, that other person who's helping you could also help
你找来的人可以提供

709
00:26:58,313 --> 00:26:59,845
you with things, maybe giving you assets,
一些帮助，给你一些资源

710
00:26:59,847 --> 00:27:01,647
maybe they could give you some images or

00:27:01,649 --> 00:27:04,216
they might give you access to a database or something,
或者他们可以给你一些数据方面的资源

712
00:27:04,218 --> 00:27:06,451
or some network server that you're gonna oh,
或许是一些你需要的网络服务

713
00:27:06,453 --> 00:27:07,852
perfectly fair game.
公平的游戏

714
00:27:07,854 --> 00:27:09,854
It's just they cannot help you with the actual
限制就是不能让他们来帮你

715
00:27:09,856 --> 00:27:11,121
coding of your app.
写代码

716
00:27:11,123 --> 00:27:13,156
And it can't be someone else in the class either.
而且这个人也不能在我们的课堂中

717
00:27:13,158 --> 00:27:14,290
Okay? It's gotta be someone
好吗？这个人必须是

718
00:27:14,292 --> 00:27:15,158
outside of this class.
在课堂以外的人

719
00:27:16,928 --> 00:27:18,327
Okay?

720
00:27:18,329 --> 00:27:21,296
So I do have two people here, two Stanford affiliates,

721
00:27:21,298 --> 00:27:22,597
who are going to get up and

talk a little bit about what they're doing.

00:27:25,001 --> 00:27:27,034
And if you like what they're doing,
而你很喜欢他们的想法

724
00:27:27,036 --> 00:27:28,535
then you can contact them,
那么你可以联系他们

725
00:27:28,537 --> 00:27:32,005
and maybe they would be your outside idea man or woman.
或许他们会是你在外部的想法来源

726
00:27:32,007 --> 00:27:34,874
And you could work with with them to
你也可以和他们一起工作

727
00:27:34,876 --> 00:27:37,310
understand more what they want.
知道他们到底想要什么

728
00:27:37,311 --> 00:27:39,745
Now what they want might not be suitable,
他们现在想要的东西或许不适合

729
00:27:39,748 --> 00:27:42,348
exactly, for a final project, because you know what
比如对于最终项目来说，因为你知道

730
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:44,116
the requirements are, you've seen them all today.
要求有那些，你今天已经看到了所有的要求

731
00:27:44,118 --> 00:27:46,752
They're specific academic requirements, and
这些全都属于学术要求

732
00:27:46,754 --> 00:27:48,219
you got to meet those.
你也必须达成这些要求

733
00:27:48,221 --> 00:27:51,422
But by the same token, what you do,
但与此同时，你要做的

734
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:54,258
what their idea is might help guide you towards
他们的点子或者会引导你

735
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:56,593
putting together a lot of good features, and vice versa.
扩展出非常多好的功能，反之亦然

736
00:27:56,595 --> 00:27:58,829
If you work with these people and
如果你和一些人工作

737
00:27:58,831 --> 00:28:01,264
you find out this is great, this is really interesting
你觉得他们的想法很棒，很有意思

738
00:28:01,266 --> 00:28:03,199
maybe then after the class is over you can say okay,
或许你可以在课程结束之后

739
00:28:03,201 --> 00:28:04,700
well now let's work together and
再与他们合作

740
00:28:04,702 --> 00:28:07,169
go do something really what we want to do,
去做一些真正有意思的东西
 
741
00:28:07,171 --> 00:28:09,037
based the specs of what the requirements are.
而不是依照要求做的东西

742
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:09,971
That make sense?
很合理吧？

743
00:28:11,574 --> 00:28:15,643
So back to learning about iOS itself.
让我们回到 iOS 的学习中

744
00:28:15,645 --> 00:28:19,079
The next thing I'm going to talk about is the unwind
下一个我们要说到的东西是 unwind 

745
00:28:19,081 --> 00:28:20,464
segue.
segue

746
00:28:20,465 --> 00:28:21,848
Now this is kind of a weird thing,
这是一个很奇怪的东西

747
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:25,284
because I talked to you about all this stuff about segues,
因为之前告诉过你们 segues 是什么

748
00:28:25,286 --> 00:28:27,319
and then the unwind comes along and
现在来了个 unwind 

749
00:28:27,321 --> 00:28:30,322
unwinds a little bit of your knowledge about it.
unwinds 你应该知道一点点

750
00:28:30,324 --> 00:28:33,625
The most important difference of an unwind segue versus all
它与你知道的那些 segues 最重要的区别就是

751
00:28:33,627 --> 00:28:35,727
those other segues that you know, the show segue and
show segue 和 pop over segue 

752
00:28:35,729 --> 00:28:40,031
the pop over segue is that it does not create a new MVC.
不会创建一个新的 MVC

753
00:28:40,033 --> 00:28:42,399
It is the only segue that does not,
它唯一一种不会这样的

754
00:28:42,401 --> 00:28:46,269
in the process of seguing, create a new instance of MVC.
在 segue 的过程中，创建一个新的 MVC

755
00:28:46,271 --> 00:28:48,872
Okay?
好吗

756
00:28:48,873 --> 00:28:51,474
It can only segue to an MVC that either directly or
他只能 segue 到一个 MVC 或者

757
00:28:51,476 --> 00:28:55,310
indirectly presented the current MVC.
间接地展示当前的 MVC

758
00:28:55,312 --> 00:28:59,014
So the MVC that wants to unwind to another MVC has to
所以 MVC 需要解开另一个已经被

759
00:28:59,016 --> 00:29:03,017
have been presented directly or indirectly by that.
直接展示或者间接展示的 MVC

760
00:29:03,019 --> 00:29:04,819
So what's it good for?
这样做有什么好处呢？

761
00:29:04,821 --> 00:29:06,320
What does this unwind tell you,
解开的是什么东西

762
00:29:06,322 --> 00:29:07,754
what do we ever use it for?
我们什么时候会用到呢？

763
00:29:07,756 --> 00:29:09,639
Well, it's really good for
好了，这就是一个非常好的时刻

764
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,523
jumping back the stack of the navigation controller.
回到之前学习的 navigation controller 栈中

765
00:29:11,526 --> 00:29:13,426
All right, so you got the navigation controller.
好的，你有一个 navigation controller

766
00:29:13,428 --> 00:29:16,529
You've got six cards, you know, things stacked on there,
你有六张卡牌，你知道，有一叠在那

767
00:29:16,531 --> 00:29:17,930
and you want to jump back to number two,
你需要返回到第二张

768
00:29:17,932 --> 00:29:20,365
or all the way back to number one.
或者一直返回到第一张卡牌

769
00:29:20,367 --> 00:29:22,334
Okay?
好吗

770
00:29:22,335 --> 00:29:24,302
Well, in the navigation controller, each card down
在 navigation controller 中，每一张卡

771
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:27,872
is considered to have been presented by the previous one.
是被前一张卡片展示出来的

772
00:29:27,874 --> 00:29:30,508
So it falls into this unwind segue thing where directly or
所以，unwind segue 能做的就是让你直接或者

773
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:32,042
indirectly you can go back up.
间接地回到之前的位置

774
00:29:32,044 --> 00:29:33,143
Unwind up.
解开连接

775
00:29:33,144 --> 00:29:34,243
So that's one good thing about it.
所以这是它的一个优点

776
00:29:34,246 --> 00:29:38,248
Another one is you have an MVC that's modally presented.
另一个是，你有一个 MVC 并且是通过 modal 的方式展示的

777
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:41,050
Now again, I haven't talked really too much about modal
其实我还没有怎么说过 modal 类型的

778
00:29:41,052 --> 00:29:42,368
presentation.
展示

779
00:29:42,369 --> 00:29:43,685
I'm going to talk a little bit more about it today.
我今天就会讲到一点

780
00:29:43,688 --> 00:29:45,854
But modal, I told you what modal is though.
但 modal，我告诉你 modal 是什么

781
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:49,291
Modal segue means take over the entire screen.
Modal segue 的意思就是取代整个屏幕

782
00:29:49,293 --> 00:29:51,993
Even a pop over is basically modal, because when
pop over 就是一种 modal，因为

783
00:29:51,995 --> 00:29:53,995
a popover's up you can't do anything except for
每当一个 popover 展示出来，除了这个 popover

784
00:29:53,997 --> 00:29:55,530
what's in that popover.
其他的东西你都无法操作

785
00:29:55,531 --> 00:29:57,064
The only other thing you can do is dismiss the popover by
你能够做的操作就是通过点击某处，来 dismiss

786
00:29:57,066 --> 00:29:57,898
clicking somewhere else.
popover

787
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,717
So that's kind of modal.
这就是 modal

788
00:29:59,718 --> 00:30:01,535
It puts your app in a mode where you can only work
他会让你的 app 进入某种模式，你只能操作

789
00:30:01,537 --> 00:30:03,604
in that one space.
这个区域

790
00:30:03,605 --> 00:30:05,672
So a lot of the time when a modal segue comes up
所以在大多数情况下，在使用了 model segue 视图显示在

791
00:30:05,674 --> 00:30:09,442
on the screen, when it's done it wants to
屏幕上并且通过它我们得到了想要的

792
00:30:09,444 --> 00:30:14,546
communicate some results back to whoever presented it, okay?
交互结果之后，就需要重新回到之前 present 的界面

793
00:30:14,548 --> 00:30:15,781
So an unwind would be great for
所以 unwind 在这里使用再不过了

794
00:30:15,783 --> 00:30:18,149
that because the only other alternative would be, like,
因为这里另一个关联就是

795
00:30:18,151 --> 00:30:20,351
delegation.
委托

796
00:30:20,352 --> 00:30:22,552
And, yes, you can have an MVC delegate back to another MVC,
是的，你也可以通过 MVC 委托回到另一个 MVC 中

797
00:30:22,555 --> 00:30:25,122
because we remember that delegation is our view,
因为我们记得委托的是我们的视图

798
00:30:25,124 --> 00:30:28,158
talking back blind to our controller.
回到之前绑定的控制器中

799
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:31,028
And remember that an MVC can be part of the view of another
但需要记住的是，一个 MVC 也可以是另一个 MVC 中的 View

800
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:33,830
MVC, so it's legal to use delegation.
所以使用委托也是可以的

801
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:35,932
But unwind, it's just a lot easier.
但 unwind，就会让事情变得更简单

802
00:30:35,934 --> 00:30:40,836
Okay, unwind provides a little pipe for the modal segue to
unwind 会提供一些方法让 modal segue

803
00:30:40,838 --> 00:30:43,605
unwind back to the one that presented it and
与之前 present 的控制器交流或者解绑

804
00:30:43,607 --> 00:30:47,408
communicate with it, okay, by segueing to it, basically.
好吧，基本上是通过 segue 来做到这一点的

805
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:48,442
All right.
好了

806
00:30:48,444 --> 00:30:49,443
So how does it work?
它是怎么使用的呢

807
00:30:49,445 --> 00:30:52,913
Instead of Ctrl+dragging
之前的从另一个

808
00:30:52,915 --> 00:30:56,449
from something to another MVC, okay?
MVC Ctrl+拖动 不同

809
00:30:56,451 --> 00:30:59,519
You can't really Ctrl+drag to the presenter.
你不能在 presenter 那里 Ctrl+拖动

810
00:30:59,521 --> 00:31:02,188
It might be in weird places in your storyboard.
这样在你的 storyboard 里面会很奇怪

811
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:04,423
It might not make sense.
完全没有道理

812
00:31:04,424 --> 00:31:06,657
So instead, you Ctrl+drag to this little button at the top
以此代替，你可以在所有的 view controller 上 Ctrl+拖动这个

813
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:09,961
of every view controller which is called the Exit icon.
有 Exit 图标的小按钮

814
00:31:09,963 --> 00:31:12,664
You see it there, it has the word exit.
你能够看到有个 Exit 在那

815
00:31:12,666 --> 00:31:16,267
And when you Ctrl+drag to that exit, okay, to make the segue,
然后然你 Ctrl+拖动到那个按钮的时候，创建了 segue

816
00:31:16,269 --> 00:31:19,136
it's gonna say, okay, where do you wanna segue to?
它会提示，你想要 segue 到哪里？

817
00:31:19,138 --> 00:31:22,039
And instead of specifying a particular MVC,
与之前不同，不是指定特定的 MVC

818
00:31:22,041 --> 00:31:26,076
you specify a special IBAction, okay?
你需要指定特定的一个 IBAction 控件

819
00:31:26,078 --> 00:31:29,579
So my IBAction here I only wanna have is go back.
所以在我的 IBAction 这里我想要让他返回上一级

820
00:31:29,581 --> 00:31:31,948
All right, that's the name of an IBAction method,
好了，这是 IBAction 方法的名字

821
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:35,417
somewhere in some MVC out there.
在某个 MVC 里面

822
00:31:35,419 --> 00:31:36,985
Okay?

823
00:31:36,986 --> 00:31:38,552
Now what's special about it is the argument of it,
特别之处在于参数

824
00:31:38,555 --> 00:31:39,921
is a UI storyboard segue.
他是一个 UIStoryboard segue

825
00:31:39,923 --> 00:31:42,757
The same argument that's given to prepare for segue, okay,
与 prepareForSegue 的参数相同

826
00:31:42,759 --> 00:31:43,775
UI storyboard segue.
UIStoryboardSegue

827
00:31:43,776 --> 00:31:44,792
That's what makes it special.
这就是其特别之处

828
00:31:44,794 --> 00:31:49,396
So when you add an IBAction method to any MVC and
当你在任何一个 MVC 中添加了 IBAction 方法

829
00:31:49,398 --> 00:31:52,098
the argument of it is a UI storyboard segue,
如果它的参数是 UIStoryboardSegue

830
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:54,300
then when people Ctrl+drag to their exit,
当大家 Ctrl+拖动到退出按钮的时候

831
00:31:54,302 --> 00:31:56,502
they'll see it in this list, okay?
他们会看到这些方法出来列表中

832
00:31:56,504 --> 00:31:57,936
So it can be any MVC anywhere.
所以他们可以在任何一个 MVC 中

833
00:31:57,938 --> 00:32:00,872
Now of course if you try to unwind, and
当然如果你现在尝试着 unwind

834
00:32:00,874 --> 00:32:03,241
you pick a method in an MVC, and
你选择了 MVC 中的一个方法

835
00:32:03,243 --> 00:32:07,211
no MVC presented you that implements that method.
那么在 MVC 中你实现的这个方法

836
00:32:07,213 --> 00:32:09,780
Then the unwind segue's gonna do nothing, okay?
unwind segue 不会有任何效果

837
00:32:09,782 --> 00:32:12,249
Because it's not gonna be able to find a presenter who
因为它没有办法找到实现了

838
00:32:12,251 --> 00:32:14,284
implements this method, okay?
这个方法的 presenter 

839
00:32:14,286 --> 00:32:16,419
So, but let's say you do have a presenter.
但这么说吧，你有一个 presenter

840
00:32:16,421 --> 00:32:18,621
Let's say you're in a navigation controller and
假设你在一个 navigation controller 中

841
00:32:18,623 --> 00:32:22,458
somebody who put you on screen has this method.
然后把你展示在屏幕上的某人有这个方法

842
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:24,143
Go back.
回去

843
00:32:24,144 --> 00:32:25,827
You see it takes a UI story board segue there.
你看到一个 UIStoryboardSegue 

844
00:32:25,829 --> 00:32:29,064
Then if I wire up my unwind segue to that then I am
如果我连接了我的 unwind segue

845
00:32:29,066 --> 00:32:31,666
basically going to be segueing back to that presenter.
那么我就可以 segue 回到那个 presenter

846
00:32:32,735 --> 00:32:35,869
Okay, so that's how you hook it up, basically.
基本上这就是如何连接的

847
00:32:35,871 --> 00:32:39,506
All right, now what happens once you get this hooked up?
好，那么当你连接这些东西之后会发生什么呢

848
00:32:41,176 --> 00:32:43,042
So there has to be IBAction and
这里有个 IBAction

849
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:45,344
there has to be UIStoryboardSegue.
他们必须要有 UIStoryboardSegue 作为参数

850
00:32:45,346 --> 00:32:48,380
Okay, otherwise IX code will not be able to detect
否则 Xcode 不能检测到

851
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:54,752
that possible unwind.
那些可以使用的 unwind

852
00:32:54,754 --> 00:32:57,654
Okay, so when you segue, it is a normal segue
好了，当你 segue 的时候，这就是在 prepareForSegue： 中的

853
00:32:57,656 --> 00:33:00,424
in that you get to prepare for segue, right?
一个普通的 segue 对吧

854
00:33:00,426 --> 00:33:03,593
So the guy on the right there, he gets to implement
在右边的这个家伙，他实现了

855
00:33:03,595 --> 00:33:06,529
prepareForSegue and when the unwind happens to his little
prepareForSegue 然后当 unwind 在他的退出按钮按下时

856
00:33:06,531 --> 00:33:08,397
exit button, and he starts looking for
他就会开始寻找那个

857
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:10,866
that go back method somewhere in a presenter.
把他展示出来的类

858
00:33:11,835 --> 00:33:13,885
He's going to get to prepare.
他就会得到 prepare

859
00:33:13,886 --> 00:33:15,936
So you just implement normal prepareForSegue inside of
如果你就是实现了 prepareForSegue 的那个人

860
00:33:15,939 --> 00:33:20,108
that guy, and the presenter, okay, is gonna get prepared.
作为展示者，就会需要准备好

861
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:22,510
And then the presenter's also going to have this go back
然后在 presenter 准备好了之后

862
00:33:22,512 --> 00:33:25,245
method called after he's prepared.
他就会拥有这个方法

863
00:33:25,247 --> 00:33:26,246
Okay?

864
00:33:26,248 --> 00:33:29,449
So the presenter gets really prepared, kinda,
当一个 presenter 确实准备好了

865
00:33:29,451 --> 00:33:31,017
or gets information twice.
他会得到两次这样的信息

866
00:33:31,019 --> 00:33:34,086
It gets it once when it's preparedForSegue, because
第一次就是 preparedForSegue

867
00:33:34,088 --> 00:33:37,823
it's the destination MVC and it's going to get prepared.
因为这就是 MVC 的目的，它就会准备好

868
00:33:38,959 --> 00:33:41,259
Now it's already here so it's already pretty prepared but
现在它已经准备好了

869
00:33:41,261 --> 00:33:42,760
maybe it gets prepared more.
但或许它需要再准备一下

870
00:33:42,762 --> 00:33:44,895
And then when the Segue happens,
然后当 segue 发生了

871
00:33:44,897 --> 00:33:46,797
go back will be called.
goBack 方法会被调用

872
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:49,733
And in the Segue that's passed as the argument there,
并且在这个 segue 参数这里

873
00:33:49,735 --> 00:33:53,602
the presenter can find out who is segueing to me, and
presenter 可以知道是谁在向我 segue

874
00:33:53,604 --> 00:33:54,903
what are they communicating to me?
到底是谁在向我联系

875
00:33:54,905 --> 00:33:56,204
What do they want to communicate to me,
为什么他们要与我交流

876
00:33:56,206 --> 00:33:58,373
in fact they can talk too, it uses public API to get
他们也确实可以交流，可以使用公共方法

877
00:33:58,375 --> 00:33:59,841
whatever information they want.
获得他们想知道的任何信息

878
00:33:59,843 --> 00:34:02,910
So basically it creates a link.
基本上会创建一个连接

879
00:34:02,912 --> 00:34:05,813
So you will be dismissed in the process.
你可以在这个过程中 dismiss 

880
00:34:05,815 --> 00:34:08,415
When you unwind, when the user clicks on whatever you
当然你 unwind 当用户点击了任何你

881
00:34:08,417 --> 00:34:12,352
control-dragged to that exit button, after this happens
之前 control-拖动到退出按钮的控件

882
00:34:12,354 --> 00:34:15,187
you're gonna get always get dismissed.
那么你就会消失掉

883
00:34:16,156 --> 00:34:17,255
Okay? So
那么

884
00:34:17,256 --> 00:34:18,355
if you're in the navigation controller,
如果你在 navigation controller 里面

885
00:34:18,358 --> 00:34:20,858
the navigation will pop back up to the presenter.
这个 navigation 将会返回到展示它的那个类那里

886
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:22,393
If you're modal, you will go away,
如果你是通过 modal 的方式展示你会消失

887
00:34:22,395 --> 00:34:24,695
you'll stop taking over the whole screen.
不再接管整个屏幕

888
00:34:24,697 --> 00:34:26,580
Okay?

889
00:34:26,581 --> 00:34:28,464
So you are gonna unwind, that's why we kind of call it
如果你要 unwind，这也是为什么我们叫他

890
00:34:28,467 --> 00:34:33,703
unwinding, you're wound up and now you kind of get unwound.
unwinding，你们会解开之间的联系

891
00:34:33,705 --> 00:34:34,937
So yeah, so Modal segues,
好了，Modal segues

892
00:34:34,939 --> 00:34:38,273
navigation controllers, exactly the same mechanism.
导航控制，基本上是相同的机制

893
00:34:38,275 --> 00:34:39,474
All right, so that's it for unwind,
好了，这就是 unwind

894
00:34:39,476 --> 00:34:41,326
it's as simple as that.
就是这么简单

895
00:34:41,327 --> 00:34:43,177
You could possibly use unwind in your assignment
你可以根据你的需求

896
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:44,312
four if you want.
尽情地使用 unwind

897
00:34:44,314 --> 00:34:47,682
I talk about it in the required task and the hints.
我会在附加任务中提到，并且有提示

898
00:34:47,684 --> 00:34:49,383
It's not a required task,
这并不是一个必做的任务

899
00:34:49,385 --> 00:34:52,219
it's just a way you could do it, okay?
这只是一个选项而已

900
00:34:52,221 --> 00:34:54,587
And you can decide whether you wanna use an unwind or not.
你可以选择使用或者不使用 unwind

901
00:34:54,589 --> 00:34:56,989
It would be a good experience for you to use an unwind.
如果你要使用 unwind 的话，这会是一个很好的例子

902
00:34:56,991 --> 00:34:59,258
Question. >> Is the default background
学生提问

903
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:03,061
in the navigation controller actually doing that?

904
00:35:03,063 --> 00:35:03,962
>> Yes. The question is,
>> 好的，问题是

905
00:35:03,964 --> 00:35:06,130
is the back button unwinding?
是否回退按钮在处理 unwind

906
00:35:06,132 --> 00:35:07,698
And the answer is no.
答案是不

907
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:11,568
That back button is wired to a method navigation controller,
回退按钮只是连接了 navigation controller 中的方法

908
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:13,670
called pop view controller.
叫做 pop view controller

909
00:35:13,672 --> 00:35:14,955
And it just pops up,
它只是弹出了

910
00:35:14,956 --> 00:35:16,239
so it doesn't get to do any of the unwinding.
所以并没有参与到 unwind 当中来

911
00:35:16,241 --> 00:35:18,941
It doesn't get to be prepared, you don't get the,
它没有得到准备，而且你也不会

912
00:35:18,943 --> 00:35:21,343
you don't have to implement that action with the,
你也不需要实现这个方法

913
00:35:21,345 --> 00:35:24,479
so it's no, the answer is no [COUGH].
所以不，答案是不

914
00:35:24,481 --> 00:35:26,014
Okay any other questions about unwind?
好了，有其他与 unwind 相关的问题吗？

915
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:29,216
Okay, next topic.
好了，下一个话题

916
00:35:29,218 --> 00:35:31,552
Alerts and Action Sheets, okay?
Alerts 和 Action Sheets

917
00:35:31,554 --> 00:35:34,388
So there are two kinds of "pop up and

918
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:37,657
ask the user something" mechanisms in iOS.

919
00:35:37,659 --> 00:35:40,426
One is called an alert, and one is called an action sheet.

920
00:35:40,428 --> 00:35:44,596
And they use, actually, exactly the same API.

921
00:35:44,598 --> 00:35:47,132
You set them up in exactly the same way and

922
00:35:47,134 --> 00:35:48,933
I'm gonna show you how that works.

923
00:35:48,935 --> 00:35:50,468
What's the difference between the two?

924
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:51,769
Okay. Alerts, first of all,

925
00:35:51,771 --> 00:35:52,870
they pop in the middle of the screen.

926
00:35:52,872 --> 00:35:54,188
They're both modal.

927
00:35:54,189 --> 00:35:55,505
Okay? They're both basically modal

928
00:35:55,507 --> 00:35:56,806
view controllers.

929
00:35:56,808 --> 00:35:59,075
Okay? They're just kind of

930
00:35:59,077 --> 00:36:01,143
drawn in a certain way, but they're really just a modal

931
00:36:01,145 --> 00:36:03,178
view controller because they both take over the screen.

932
00:36:04,548 --> 00:36:06,614
But the alerts takes over the screen and

933
00:36:06,616 --> 00:36:09,083
comes up right in the middle.

934
00:36:09,085 --> 00:36:11,819
And usually alert is gonna ask you a question,

935
00:36:11,821 --> 00:36:15,355
ask the user a question where there is only, kind of, one or

936
00:36:15,357 --> 00:36:16,189
two answers.

937
00:36:16,191 --> 00:36:18,858
Like yes no, or do this cancel, or

938
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:20,659
something like that.

939
00:36:20,661 --> 00:36:23,462
An alert also, by the way, can also have a text field, so

940
00:36:23,464 --> 00:36:24,996
it could be like log in and

941
00:36:24,998 --> 00:36:26,931
you have to type your password in there.

942
00:36:26,933 --> 00:36:29,267
Okay or maybe even user name and password.

943
00:36:29,269 --> 00:36:30,968
So it can collect text.

944
00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:32,770
Action sheet cannot collect text from the user,

945
00:36:32,772 --> 00:36:34,771
only the alert can do that.

946
00:36:34,773 --> 00:36:37,407
But if you had a question that had more than two answers to

947
00:36:37,409 --> 00:36:40,710
it you're probably going to use an action sheet.

948
00:36:40,712 --> 00:36:43,212
Okay, so an action sheet.

949
00:36:43,214 --> 00:36:45,014
It presents on screen a little differently.

950
00:36:45,016 --> 00:36:46,348
It doesn't come up in the middle of the screen

951
00:36:46,350 --> 00:36:48,100
like an alert.

952
00:36:48,101 --> 00:36:49,851
It usually slides up from the bottom on an iPhone.

953
00:36:49,853 --> 00:36:53,254
On an IPad we usually put it up in a popover and

954
00:36:53,256 --> 00:36:56,023
I'm going to show you how we do that in a moment.

955
00:36:56,025 --> 00:36:59,493
An action sheet is sometimes referred to as a branching

956
00:36:59,495 --> 00:37:01,995
decision sheet, so where you're basically making

957
00:37:01,997 --> 00:37:04,531
a branching decision where the user wants to

958
00:37:04,533 --> 00:37:07,600
do one of three or four things and you're kind of picking

959
00:37:07,602 --> 00:37:10,436
which one you're going to do, and you're gonna head down

960
00:37:10,438 --> 00:37:11,770
that direction inside your app, okay?

961
00:37:12,806 --> 00:37:16,041
So I think by example

962
00:37:16,043 --> 00:37:18,076
is the easiest way to kind of see the difference here.

963
00:37:18,078 --> 00:37:21,679
So, I took our Cassini out that we wrote, and I added a

964
00:37:21,681 --> 00:37:25,082
little button on the top that actually controls Cassini.

965
00:37:25,084 --> 00:37:29,586
Okay, it'll redeploy Cassini off to different places, okay,

966
00:37:29,588 --> 00:37:31,954
Saturn or can send it off to Titan or

967
00:37:31,956 --> 00:37:34,990
send it towards the sun, or whatever.

968
00:37:34,992 --> 00:37:36,658
Okay so I added that little redeploy button.

969
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:38,493
You see it up in the right hand corner there?

970
00:37:38,495 --> 00:37:39,861
It says redeploy.

971
00:37:39,863 --> 00:37:43,464
So part of my implementation of allowing the scene to be

972
00:37:43,466 --> 00:37:46,200
redeployed, I use an action sheet and an alert.

973
00:37:46,202 --> 00:37:47,785
Okay?

974
00:37:47,786 --> 00:37:49,369
So here's the action sheet I used.

975
00:37:49,372 --> 00:37:51,772
When you click that redeploy button, it's gonna put up an

976
00:37:51,774 --> 00:37:54,874
action sheet that says where do you wanna send Cassini to?

977
00:37:54,876 --> 00:37:56,776
I'm sure the Cassini guys have an app just like this,

978
00:37:56,778 --> 00:37:58,611
it's how Cassini is controlled.

979
00:37:58,613 --> 00:38:02,381
But, our app only lets them send it to Saturn, or

980
00:38:02,383 --> 00:38:06,985
Titan, moon of, is that a moon of Jupiter, I guess?

981
00:38:06,987 --> 00:38:09,854
Or they can go take a closeup of the sun,

982
00:38:09,856 --> 00:38:11,689
which is going to destroy Cassini.

983
00:38:11,691 --> 00:38:13,757
Okay? Because it's too hot there.

984
00:38:13,759 --> 00:38:15,592
Or they can cancel.

985
00:38:15,593 --> 00:38:17,426
So that's the action sheet that I invented.

986
00:38:17,429 --> 00:38:20,663
And then if you decide you want to go somewhere,

987
00:38:20,665 --> 00:38:23,633
then I put up an alert that says oh, if you want to send

988
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:27,670
Cassini to Titan, you need to login and give your guidance

989
00:38:27,672 --> 00:38:30,539
system control password or something, okay?

990
00:38:30,541 --> 00:38:32,540
So this is my alert, okay?

991
00:38:32,542 --> 00:38:34,042
So we're going to look at the code,

992
00:38:34,044 --> 00:38:37,711
how I did this action sheet and alert.

993
00:38:37,713 --> 00:38:39,697
Okay? So

994
00:38:39,698 --> 00:38:41,682
let's start with the action sheet.

995
00:38:41,684 --> 00:38:44,317
Now the code for both looks incredibly similar, so

996
00:38:44,319 --> 00:38:45,852
what I'm teaching you here about action sheet,

997
00:38:45,854 --> 00:38:48,254
almost can be 100% applying to the alert.

998
00:38:48,256 --> 00:38:49,455
But basically in either case,

999
00:38:49,457 --> 00:38:52,257
you create an instance of a UIAlertController.

1000
00:38:52,259 --> 00:38:54,659
This is just a UI view controller, okay.

1001
00:38:54,661 --> 00:38:58,162
It's a sub class of a UI view controller [SOUND] that,

1002
00:38:58,164 --> 00:39:00,598
you know, gets presented modally.

1003
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,732
And that's basically it.

1004
00:39:01,734 --> 00:39:03,700
Okay, alerts and actions are basically a sub class of

1005
00:39:03,702 --> 00:39:05,268
UI view controllers that get presented modally.

1006
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:08,137
They just happen to draw on these particular ways.

1007
00:39:08,139 --> 00:39:09,939
When you create your view control, you're going to give

1008
00:39:09,941 --> 00:39:12,875
the title that you can see where the title Redeploy

1009
00:39:12,877 --> 00:39:16,544
Cassini appears there in my action sheet right at the top.

1010
00:39:16,546 --> 00:39:18,580
And then the message,

1011
00:39:18,581 --> 00:39:20,615
which will appear right below it in non bold.

1012
00:39:20,617 --> 00:39:22,550
That's actually probably using preferred fonts.

1013
00:39:22,552 --> 00:39:24,585
So that's probably actually like a headline font and

1014
00:39:24,587 --> 00:39:27,187
a body font I'm guessing.

1015
00:39:27,189 --> 00:39:29,222
And then you specify the preferred style.

1016
00:39:29,224 --> 00:39:31,224
So this is how you decide whether it's an action sheet

1017
00:39:31,226 --> 00:39:32,291
or an alert.

1018
00:39:32,293 --> 00:39:33,525
So here I'm doing action sheet so

1019
00:39:33,527 --> 00:39:35,927
I say UIAlertController style action sheet.

1020
00:39:35,929 --> 00:39:37,462
So that means I'm making an action sheet.

1021
00:39:37,464 --> 00:39:38,647
So that's it.

1022
00:39:38,648 --> 00:39:39,831
I create my view controller.

1023
00:39:39,833 --> 00:39:45,035
Now I need to add some items into there like orbit Saturn,

1024
00:39:45,037 --> 00:39:48,505
explore Titan, close up of Sun, cancel.

1025
00:39:48,507 --> 00:39:50,190
How do I do that?

1026
00:39:50,191 --> 00:39:51,874
I do that by calling the method addAction on the alert

1027
00:39:51,877 --> 00:39:54,043
on this view controller I just created.

1028
00:39:54,045 --> 00:39:56,345
And the argument to that is a UIAlertAction,

1029
00:39:56,347 --> 00:39:59,214
which is another class that I'm going to create, which

1030
00:39:59,216 --> 00:40:02,117
really just kind of collects all of the information about

1031
00:40:02,119 --> 00:40:03,284
a particular action.

1032
00:40:03,286 --> 00:40:05,887
So here is how UIAlertAction looks like.

1033
00:40:05,889 --> 00:40:07,088
It's got a title.

1034
00:40:07,090 --> 00:40:09,890
That's like Orbit Saturn there or Explore Titan,

1035
00:40:09,892 --> 00:40:11,324
that's the title.

1036
00:40:11,326 --> 00:40:12,292
It's got a style.

1037
00:40:12,294 --> 00:40:13,526
We'll talk about that in a second.

1038
00:40:13,528 --> 00:40:15,928
And then it's got a handler, okay?

1039
00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:17,763
So here, you're starting to see closures again in

1040
00:40:17,765 --> 00:40:18,864
the iOS API.

1041
00:40:18,866 --> 00:40:20,965
This handler is just a closure, okay?

1042
00:40:20,967 --> 00:40:23,801
The argument is gonna be this action itself, so

1043
00:40:23,803 --> 00:40:25,369
it's basically like sender.

1044
00:40:25,371 --> 00:40:28,238
And inside this closure, you can do whatever you wanna do

1045
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,340
when they click on that particular action,

1046
00:40:30,342 --> 00:40:31,608
like Orbit Saturn.

1047
00:40:31,610 --> 00:40:33,776
So the code in there would probably go off and

1048
00:40:33,778 --> 00:40:38,013
send Cassini instructions to go Orbit Saturn, okay?

1049
00:40:38,015 --> 00:40:39,581
So let's look at an example of one of these.

1050
00:40:39,583 --> 00:40:40,982
Let's look at Orbit Saturn.

1051
00:40:40,984 --> 00:40:44,652
The title is Orbit Saturn, the style is default, okay?

1052
00:40:44,654 --> 00:40:46,587
We'll talk about some other styles in a second here, but

1053
00:40:46,589 --> 00:40:48,522
default is just the default line,

1054
00:40:48,524 --> 00:40:50,957
this blue colored text right there, like Orbit Saturn,

1055
00:40:50,959 --> 00:40:53,793
Explore Titan, they're both that.

1056
00:40:53,795 --> 00:40:55,445
And then the closure I'm

1057
00:40:55,446 --> 00:40:57,096
gonna put is just to go into orbit around Saturn.

1058
00:40:57,098 --> 00:40:59,932
And similarly, Explore Titan would look exactly the same,

1059
00:40:59,934 --> 00:41:02,134
also default style.

1060
00:41:02,136 --> 00:41:05,904
And maybe Cassini's mission was I think to orbit Saturn or

1061
00:41:05,906 --> 00:41:07,172
go to Saturn.

1062
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:08,439
So maybe if you're gonna switch it over to going to

1063
00:41:08,441 --> 00:41:11,709
Titan then you have to log in and do your guidance password.

1064
00:41:11,711 --> 00:41:13,677
Otherwise, you can always send Cassini back to

1065
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:15,145
Saturn, I guess.

1066
00:41:15,147 --> 00:41:16,279
Okay.

1067
00:41:16,281 --> 00:41:19,082
So there's the example of the default actions.

1068
00:41:19,084 --> 00:41:21,484
So let's look at the next one, that Closeup of Sun.

1069
00:41:21,486 --> 00:41:24,820
So the Closeup of Sun is almost exactly the same except

1070
00:41:24,822 --> 00:41:28,223
for its style is not default, it's .Destructive.

1071
00:41:29,225 --> 00:41:31,025
Okay?

1072
00:41:31,026 --> 00:41:32,826
So .Destructive makes it show up in red.

1073
00:41:32,829 --> 00:41:34,995
So anything that's gonna really damage something,

1074
00:41:34,997 --> 00:41:38,465
like delete this entry, or something like that,

1075
00:41:38,467 --> 00:41:41,868
you can make it .Destructive and it will show up in red.

1076
00:41:41,870 --> 00:41:43,486
Okay.

1077
00:41:43,487 --> 00:41:45,103
Otherwise, it's exactly the same as the other ones.

1078
00:41:45,106 --> 00:41:48,707
And then the Cancel one also has a special thing, .Cancel.

1079
00:41:48,709 --> 00:41:49,541
All right?

1080
00:41:49,543 --> 00:41:52,343
And you can see that Cancel is

1081
00:41:52,345 --> 00:41:54,412
kinda separated from the rest of em?

1082
00:41:54,414 --> 00:41:56,747
It's down at the bottom, it's got a little extra space.

1083
00:41:56,749 --> 00:41:58,849
That's pretty much the only difference between Cancel,

1084
00:41:58,851 --> 00:42:01,484
cuz you still get a closure there you get to execute,

1085
00:42:01,486 --> 00:42:02,485
when it's clicked on.

1086
00:42:04,222 --> 00:42:06,022
Okay, so that's it.

1087
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:07,823
So, alerts couldn't be any simpler to create, okay?

1088
00:42:07,825 --> 00:42:10,258
So that's how you create this view controller and

1089
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:11,960
configure it with its actions.

1090
00:42:11,962 --> 00:42:13,594
Now, how do we put this thing on screen?

1091
00:42:13,596 --> 00:42:15,529
How do we get this alert to actually slide up

1092
00:42:15,531 --> 00:42:16,614
from the bottom?

1093
00:42:16,615 --> 00:42:17,698
Well, it's just a UIViewController,

1094
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:19,066
we're gonna present it modally.

1095
00:42:19,068 --> 00:42:21,801
So, there's a method in UIViewController called

1096
00:42:21,803 --> 00:42:23,102
presentViewController.

1097
00:42:23,104 --> 00:42:24,437
I haven't really talked about it cause

1098
00:42:24,439 --> 00:42:26,505
we haven't talked about modal presentation.

1099
00:42:26,507 --> 00:42:28,407
But all presentViewController is,

1100
00:42:28,409 --> 00:42:31,276
it presents a view controller on screen.

1101
00:42:31,278 --> 00:42:33,444
And if it's a modal view controller like alerts are,

1102
00:42:33,446 --> 00:42:34,545
it'll appear modally.

1103
00:42:35,648 --> 00:42:37,314
Okay? It only has three arguments

1104
00:42:37,316 --> 00:42:40,684
which is the UIViewController to present,

1105
00:42:40,686 --> 00:42:44,687
whether to animate it so in the case of the action sheet,

1106
00:42:44,689 --> 00:42:46,655
it slides up from the bottom.

1107
00:42:46,657 --> 00:42:48,557
And then you also get a closure there,

1108
00:42:48,559 --> 00:42:52,327
completion, which will get called, this is closure,

1109
00:42:52,329 --> 00:42:53,928
it takes no arguments, returns nothing.

1110
00:42:53,930 --> 00:42:55,396
It'll have when it's done.

1111
00:42:55,398 --> 00:42:58,565
So when that thing has been finally presented on screen

1112
00:42:58,567 --> 00:43:00,000
and done its animation, boom,

1113
00:43:00,002 --> 00:43:01,801
you'll get your completion called.

1114
00:43:01,803 --> 00:43:03,770
You almost never do anything there.

1115
00:43:03,772 --> 00:43:05,338
It's really, doesn't make a lot of sense.

1116
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:07,740
The things already up, it's doing its business.

1117
00:43:07,742 --> 00:43:09,941
There's really no business for you, as its presenter,

1118
00:43:09,943 --> 00:43:12,544
to be doing at that point, but you could, okay?

1119
00:43:13,813 --> 00:43:16,747
So that's it, UIAlerts are just UIViewController.

1120
00:43:16,749 --> 00:43:19,750
Just add actions to them, then you present them.

1121
00:43:19,752 --> 00:43:24,821
Now, what about this action sheet thing though on an iPad?

1122
00:43:25,824 --> 00:43:28,357
Okay? So here's same app in iPad and

1123
00:43:28,359 --> 00:43:30,492
I got that redeploy button up there in the right.

1124
00:43:30,494 --> 00:43:32,861
Now look what happens when I do redeploy in the iPad.

1125
00:43:34,030 --> 00:43:35,396
Same thing.

1126
00:43:35,398 --> 00:43:37,865
But it shows up in a popover.

1127
00:43:38,834 --> 00:43:39,733
Okay? It doesn't

1128
00:43:39,735 --> 00:43:41,268
slide up from the bottom.

1129
00:43:41,269 --> 00:43:42,802
It wouldn't look very good if it slid up from the bottom.

1130
00:43:42,804 --> 00:43:45,938
It would either be kinda silly narrow, or

1131
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:48,907
it would be so fat and wide it would look ridiculous.

1132
00:43:48,909 --> 00:43:51,443
It makes much more sense to put it in a popover like that.

1133
00:43:51,445 --> 00:43:54,879
Notice that the popover is different in one big way.

1134
00:43:54,881 --> 00:43:57,015
No cancel button, okay?

1135
00:43:57,017 --> 00:43:58,983
And that's because you don't need a cancel button to

1136
00:43:58,985 --> 00:44:00,250
cancel a popover.

1137
00:44:00,252 --> 00:44:03,086
A popover is modal, and if you click anywhere else in your

1138
00:44:03,088 --> 00:44:05,488
app, boom, it's gonna cancel that popover.

1139
00:44:05,490 --> 00:44:09,092
But if you have a cancel action, like this one does,

1140
00:44:09,094 --> 00:44:11,394
its actions still will be called,

1141
00:44:11,396 --> 00:44:13,862
even in the popover cancel case.

1142
00:44:13,864 --> 00:44:15,614
Okay?

1143
00:44:15,615 --> 00:44:17,365
So that cancel thing is kind of still in play,

1144
00:44:17,368 --> 00:44:18,733
it's just that you access it differently.

1145
00:44:18,735 --> 00:44:20,668
Instead of hitting the Cancel button like the bottom of

1146
00:44:20,670 --> 00:44:22,937
the iPhone version, you just click somewhere else and

1147
00:44:22,939 --> 00:44:23,771
make the popover go away.

1148
00:44:25,107 --> 00:44:26,172
Everyone understand that?

1149
00:44:26,174 --> 00:44:27,907
All right, but how do we make this work?

1150
00:44:27,909 --> 00:44:31,677
Because this is not quite enough information

1151
00:44:31,679 --> 00:44:34,112
to present that popover, okay?

1152
00:44:34,114 --> 00:44:36,247
That popover needs one really important piece of

1153
00:44:36,249 --> 00:44:39,183
information, which is who is popping me up?

1154
00:44:39,185 --> 00:44:40,985
Because you see it has that little white triangle

1155
00:44:40,987 --> 00:44:43,320
at the top that's pointing to redeploy?

1156
00:44:43,322 --> 00:44:46,189
So nowhere here are we saying, oh, Mr.

1157
00:44:46,191 --> 00:44:49,759
Popover, point to that redeploy button, okay?

1158
00:44:49,761 --> 00:44:51,294
So we need to say that.

1159
00:44:51,296 --> 00:44:55,131
So that means when we put any action sheet up and it's

1160
00:44:55,133 --> 00:44:59,134
gonna happen on an iPad where there might be a popover.

1161
00:44:59,136 --> 00:45:00,869
We need to get a hold of the popover

1162
00:45:00,871 --> 00:45:02,403
presentation controller.

1163
00:45:02,405 --> 00:45:05,473
The same one we got ahold of, back when we were doing

1164
00:45:05,475 --> 00:45:09,509
the popover in the previous app, the psychologist app.

1165
00:45:09,511 --> 00:45:11,478
Same popover presentation controller.

1166
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:13,379
We need to get it and we just need to tell it,

1167
00:45:13,381 --> 00:45:15,014
here's the button that's presenting you, so

1168
00:45:15,016 --> 00:45:16,615
you can point to it.

1169
00:45:16,617 --> 00:45:17,315
Okay?

1170
00:45:17,317 --> 00:45:18,416
So we do that like this.

1171
00:45:19,686 --> 00:45:21,736
First of all,

1172
00:45:21,737 --> 00:45:23,787
just have to say that the alerts presentation style,

1173
00:45:23,790 --> 00:45:27,558
its modal presentation style, is popover presentation style.

1174
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:30,360
If we don't tell it that, then it will never make a popover

1175
00:45:30,362 --> 00:45:31,695
presentation controller.

1176
00:45:31,697 --> 00:45:34,797
So we can't tell it anything cause it won't exist.

1177
00:45:34,799 --> 00:45:37,667
But once we say that this UIViewController

1178
00:45:37,669 --> 00:45:40,536
modalPresentationStyle is a popover, now we can say okay,

1179
00:45:40,538 --> 00:45:43,105
well give me the popover presentation controller.

1180
00:45:43,107 --> 00:45:45,073
And the BarButtonItem,

1181
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:48,509
which is that redeploy up there is this.

1182
00:45:48,511 --> 00:45:51,812
And so I point it to the redeployBarButtonItem, and

1183
00:45:51,814 --> 00:45:55,682
now when it pops over, when it gets presented modally here,

1184
00:45:55,684 --> 00:45:57,717
using a popover presentation,

1185
00:45:57,719 --> 00:46:00,653
it will point to the redeployButton, okay?

1186
00:46:02,556 --> 00:46:05,991
The cool thing is because of adaptive UIs,

1187
00:46:05,993 --> 00:46:07,726
which we talked about back then,

1188
00:46:07,728 --> 00:46:10,828
is that this code works exactly the same on iPhone.

1189
00:46:12,098 --> 00:46:14,898
So if you put in those three lines to make the popover

1190
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:17,000
work, it won't effect the iPhone at all.

1191
00:46:17,002 --> 00:46:21,470
Because the iPhone already adapts popovers to present

1192
00:46:21,472 --> 00:46:23,172
over the whole screen, remember?

1193
00:46:23,174 --> 00:46:25,807
And in fact, we had to go do some work in psychologists

1194
00:46:25,809 --> 00:46:29,377
to stop it from doing that adapting.

1195
00:46:29,379 --> 00:46:31,612
So that it would show up in a little popover on the phone.

1196
00:46:31,614 --> 00:46:33,047
But if you don't do any of that work,

1197
00:46:33,049 --> 00:46:35,883
then by default it shows just like this.

1198
00:46:35,885 --> 00:46:37,751
Until it takes over the whole screen on the iPhone.

1199
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:40,620
So that's why setting the modal presentation style to

1200
00:46:40,622 --> 00:46:43,723
popover still works on the iPhone because it adapts.

1201
00:46:45,226 --> 00:46:46,291
Okay?

1202
00:46:46,293 --> 00:46:47,258
Any questions about that?

1203
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:48,726
So that's how you do an action sheet.

1204
00:46:48,728 --> 00:46:51,595
You're gonna do the same body of code you see right there

1205
00:46:51,597 --> 00:46:53,030
for every action sheet you ever do.

1206
00:46:54,466 --> 00:46:56,566
All right, now, let's go talk about the alert.

1207
00:46:56,568 --> 00:46:57,767
Okay.

1208
00:46:57,768 --> 00:46:58,967
The only difference in creating the view controller

1209
00:46:58,970 --> 00:47:01,771
is you say that its style is alert instead of action sheet.

1210
00:47:01,773 --> 00:47:03,472
Otherwise, it's exactly the same.

1211
00:47:03,474 --> 00:47:05,474
Okay, iPad different text here,

1212
00:47:05,476 --> 00:47:07,709
obviously login required and please enter your Cassini

1213
00:47:07,711 --> 00:47:10,745
guidance system password instead of the other things.

1214
00:47:10,747 --> 00:47:12,580
But, otherwise I'm just changing

1215
00:47:12,582 --> 00:47:14,181
the style to be alert.

1216
00:47:14,183 --> 00:47:15,782
I do the same thing with adding actions.

1217
00:47:15,784 --> 00:47:18,118
So, here I'm gonna add the Cancel button.

1218
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:21,020
Okay, I'm gonna add the Login button.

1219
00:47:21,022 --> 00:47:23,689
Now the interesting thing about the Login button is when

1220
00:47:23,691 --> 00:47:27,325
I login I wanna get the text out of that text field

1221
00:47:28,362 --> 00:47:31,595
to use as a password for my guidance system, okay?

1222
00:47:32,898 --> 00:47:35,232
So how am I gonna do that, okay.

1223
00:47:35,234 --> 00:47:36,633
Well first of all we're gonna ask,

1224
00:47:36,635 --> 00:47:38,668
how do I put that text field there?

1225
00:47:38,670 --> 00:47:40,336
Okay, I've gotta put that text field in my alert.

1226
00:47:40,338 --> 00:47:42,638
So here's how we put a text field in alert.

1227
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:45,440
Use simple method addTextFieldWithConfiguration-

1228
00:47:45,442 --> 00:47:47,709
Handler, okay?

1229
00:47:47,710 --> 00:47:49,977
When you call that, it adds the text field to the alert

1230
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:52,380
and it calls this closure so

1231
00:47:52,382 --> 00:47:54,715
that you can configure the text field however you want.

1232
00:47:54,717 --> 00:47:55,816
So here my text field,

1233
00:47:55,818 --> 00:47:58,151
I configured it to say Guidance System Password

1234
00:47:58,153 --> 00:48:00,587
as the place holder text there in the background.

1235
00:48:00,589 --> 00:48:02,155
Remember in the smash tag,

1236
00:48:02,157 --> 00:48:04,890
I had my search field say Twitter Search Query.

1237
00:48:04,892 --> 00:48:06,442
Well, here I'm having

1238
00:48:06,443 --> 00:48:07,993
this one say Guidance System Password in the background.

1239
00:48:07,995 --> 00:48:09,645
And that's it.

1240
00:48:09,646 --> 00:48:11,296
So I could do other things to set the font or

1241
00:48:11,298 --> 00:48:14,332
whatever I want of the text field there.

1242
00:48:14,334 --> 00:48:15,767
And you can call

1243
00:48:15,768 --> 00:48:17,201
addTextFieldWithConfiguration- Handler more than once and

1244
00:48:17,203 --> 00:48:18,736
then you'll get more than one text field.

1245
00:48:18,738 --> 00:48:22,973
So you could have a login and a password field.

1246
00:48:22,975 --> 00:48:24,308
Now.

1247
00:48:24,309 --> 00:48:25,642
This is great, I've got the text field in there.

1248
00:48:25,644 --> 00:48:28,211
When I click log in inside the action for

1249
00:48:28,213 --> 00:48:31,714
log in, how do I get the text out of that text field, okay?

1250
00:48:31,716 --> 00:48:34,350
Well, that looks slightly more complicated than you might

1251
00:48:34,352 --> 00:48:35,484
like, it looks like this.

1252
00:48:35,486 --> 00:48:39,320
I'm going to let TF, which is going to be a pointer to that

1253
00:48:39,322 --> 00:48:43,958
text field equal alert.text fields.

1254
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:47,227
Which is an array of any object

1255
00:48:47,229 --> 00:48:50,230
in its optional array, okay?

1256
00:48:50,232 --> 00:48:53,166
So, since it's an array, since it's optional,

1257
00:48:53,168 --> 00:48:54,834
I'm gonna put a question mark there so

1258
00:48:54,836 --> 00:48:57,603
that I can do this optional chaining and just fail.

1259
00:48:57,605 --> 00:49:00,506
So TF, let TF, that could be nil,

1260
00:49:00,508 --> 00:49:03,175
that could end up being nil.

1261
00:49:03,177 --> 00:49:05,110
That's a question mark, and then I'm gonna say .first.

1262
00:49:05,112 --> 00:49:07,562
If you remember an array,

1263
00:49:07,563 --> 00:49:10,013
the method .first returns the first thing in the array

1264
00:49:10,016 --> 00:49:11,615
if the array has anything in it.

1265
00:49:11,617 --> 00:49:12,683
If not, it returns nil.

1266
00:49:13,619 --> 00:49:14,751
So that's a great way to get something,

1267
00:49:14,753 --> 00:49:16,652
the first thing out of an array and

1268
00:49:16,654 --> 00:49:18,721
not have to check to see if anything's in the array.

1269
00:49:18,723 --> 00:49:20,889
And it'll just return nil if there's nothing in the array.

1270
00:49:22,059 --> 00:49:24,626
And then I've got to cast it to a text field because I told

1271
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:26,594
you it was an array of any object.

1272
00:49:26,596 --> 00:49:28,396
Why is it an array of any object?

1273
00:49:28,398 --> 00:49:30,364
Don't ask, historical reasons.

1274
00:49:30,366 --> 00:49:32,566
It's a way objective C cat does things,

1275
00:49:32,568 --> 00:49:35,035
it's not quite as expressive as Swift.

1276
00:49:35,037 --> 00:49:36,636
But, anyway, too bad.

1277
00:49:36,638 --> 00:49:37,570
So you do this as ?,

1278
00:49:37,572 --> 00:49:39,539
so that also could return nil.

1279
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:41,507
So, it's three different things that could return nil,

1280
00:49:41,509 --> 00:49:44,076
but if they don't, then I'm gonna get text field back.

1281
00:49:44,078 --> 00:49:45,961
And if I get a text field back,

1282
00:49:45,962 --> 00:49:47,845
then I can just take the text out of the text field and

1283
00:49:47,848 --> 00:49:50,281
log in.

1284
00:49:50,283 --> 00:49:50,848
Okay?

1285
00:49:52,251 --> 00:49:53,784
Any questions about that?

1286
00:49:53,786 --> 00:49:55,118
I know it's a little convoluted getting

1287
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:56,019
that text field out of there.

1288
00:49:56,021 --> 00:49:57,787
All right?

1289
00:49:57,789 --> 00:50:01,557
So that's it for alerts.

1290
00:50:01,559 --> 00:50:04,926
Then you just present view controller exactly the same

1291
00:50:04,928 --> 00:50:09,364
as we did for action sheet or any other modal view.

1292
00:50:09,366 --> 00:50:11,465
And how about an iPad?

1293
00:50:11,467 --> 00:50:12,867
An iPad?

1294
00:50:12,868 --> 00:50:14,268
It looks exactly the same.

1295
00:50:14,270 --> 00:50:15,502
Takes over the whole screen.

1296
00:50:15,504 --> 00:50:19,972
No need to do any popover business with alerts on iPad.

1297
00:50:19,974 --> 00:50:22,008
Okay.

1298
00:50:22,009 --> 00:50:24,043
So that's alerts and action sheets.

1299
00:50:24,045 --> 00:50:25,978
Just UIV controls that you're presenting modally

1300
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:26,645
that's all they are.

1301
00:50:26,647 --> 00:50:28,680
All right.

1302
00:50:28,682 --> 00:50:33,351
Next topic, NSTimer.

1303
00:50:33,353 --> 00:50:35,853
So NSTimer is a way to set up a timer

1304
00:50:35,855 --> 00:50:40,090
that will call a method periodically, okay?

1305
00:50:40,092 --> 00:50:42,358
Now, it uses technology called RunLoop,

1306
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:43,859
which we're not going to talk about.

1307
00:50:43,861 --> 00:50:47,196
So suffice it to say, for you, in this course,

1308
00:50:47,198 --> 00:50:50,432
you always have to use timers on the main queue, okay?

1309
00:50:50,434 --> 00:50:52,334
Because the main queue has a run loop.

1310
00:50:52,336 --> 00:50:54,268
You can actually have run loops on other queues,

1311
00:50:54,270 --> 00:50:56,737
other threads, but we're not gonna talk about that.

1312
00:50:56,739 --> 00:51:01,308
So, main queue for you, NSTimer main queue.

1313
00:51:01,310 --> 00:51:06,379
And, so this timer, it's not really a real-time timer.

1314
00:51:06,381 --> 00:51:08,748
If you say go off every two seconds,

1315
00:51:08,750 --> 00:51:12,250
it's not going to go off every 2.00000 seconds.

1316
00:51:12,252 --> 00:51:13,284
And why is that?

1317
00:51:13,286 --> 00:51:16,154
Because basically it's just putting things,

1318
00:51:16,156 --> 00:51:19,056
it's kind of like it's putting things on the main queue but

1319
00:51:19,058 --> 00:51:20,958
not, not quite the same.

1320
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:23,827
The runloop helps process things that are happening,

1321
00:51:23,829 --> 00:51:27,864
like interrupts or data that becomes available or whatever.

1322
00:51:27,866 --> 00:51:29,765
And it can't run in real-time,

1323
00:51:29,767 --> 00:51:32,501
because other things are on the main queue running.

1324
00:51:32,503 --> 00:51:33,852
Okay? Other

1325
00:51:33,853 --> 00:51:35,202
blocks of code and stuff.

1326
00:51:35,205 --> 00:51:36,838
So we can't quite guarantee it.

1327
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:38,072
But it has a high priority, so,

1328
00:51:38,074 --> 00:51:40,741
as soon as the main queue becomes available, after

1329
00:51:40,743 --> 00:51:44,178
2.0000 seconds has happened, it's gonna call your method.

1330
00:51:44,180 --> 00:51:46,413
Okay, but it's not a real time programming thing.

1331
00:51:46,415 --> 00:51:49,015
I mentioned that for those of you who are like systems

1332
00:51:49,017 --> 00:51:51,651
OS people and you're used to real time API.

1333
00:51:51,653 --> 00:51:53,386
This is not real time but it's really, really,

1334
00:51:53,388 --> 00:51:55,188
really close to real time.

1335
00:51:55,189 --> 00:51:56,989
As long as you don't have any big things on your main queue

1336
00:51:56,991 --> 00:52:00,058
that are blocking it up which you shouldn't have any

1337
00:52:00,060 --> 00:52:00,792
way, right?

1338
00:52:00,794 --> 00:52:03,594
Never block your main queue.

1339
00:52:03,596 --> 00:52:06,330
Then your timer's pretty much gonna run when you want.

1340
00:52:06,332 --> 00:52:07,965
Okay?

1341
00:52:07,966 --> 00:52:09,599
Now this is not used for animation.

1342
00:52:09,602 --> 00:52:12,602
We're going to talk all about animation later today and

1343
00:52:12,604 --> 00:52:13,603
all of next week.

1344
00:52:13,605 --> 00:52:15,238
And your assignment five is

1345
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:16,939
going to be all about animation.

1346
00:52:16,941 --> 00:52:19,775
Timer is more like a complement to animation.

1347
00:52:19,777 --> 00:52:21,843
Because when you're animating things sometimes you do want

1348
00:52:21,845 --> 00:52:23,395
to do things.

1349
00:52:23,396 --> 00:52:24,946
Something every second or every two seconds.

1350
00:52:24,948 --> 00:52:26,080
You're really not going to be, like,

1351
00:52:26,082 --> 00:52:28,282
doing something every 60th of a second.

1352
00:52:28,284 --> 00:52:29,049
Okay? 60 frames per

1353
00:52:29,051 --> 00:52:30,901
second animation,

1354
00:52:30,902 --> 00:52:32,752
you'd never do that with a timer, it's not for that.

1355
00:52:32,755 --> 00:52:33,871
Okay?

1356
00:52:33,872 --> 00:52:34,988
It's just for things like, maybe,

1357
00:52:34,990 --> 00:52:38,524
you have something where you have a score in a game and

1358
00:52:38,526 --> 00:52:40,593
you update the score every second.

1359
00:52:40,595 --> 00:52:42,061
Okay?

1360
00:52:42,062 --> 00:52:43,528
So that you're not constantly changing it,

1361
00:52:43,531 --> 00:52:44,763
something like that.

1362
00:52:44,765 --> 00:52:46,631
It's that kind of thing.

1363
00:52:46,633 --> 00:52:47,965
It's used for that kinda thing.

1364
00:52:47,967 --> 00:52:50,067
So run loops we're not going to talk about that.

1365
00:52:50,069 --> 00:52:52,336
Okay so how do you fire off one of these timers?

1366
00:52:52,338 --> 00:52:54,738
How do you make it work?

1367
00:52:54,739 --> 00:52:57,139
Well you do it with a class function in NSTimer.

1368
00:52:57,142 --> 00:53:00,710
It's called a scheduled timer with time interval.

1369
00:53:00,712 --> 00:53:02,695
Now be careful.

1370
00:53:02,696 --> 00:53:04,679
There are four methods in NSTime but it looked very,

1371
00:53:04,682 --> 00:53:05,914
very similar to this.

1372
00:53:05,916 --> 00:53:08,033
Okay? But

1373
00:53:08,034 --> 00:53:10,151
this is the one you want with this set of arguments [SOUND].

1374
00:53:10,154 --> 00:53:11,986
And the arguments are just,

1375
00:53:11,988 --> 00:53:15,323
the first one is how many seconds between firings?

1376
00:53:15,325 --> 00:53:18,159
How many seconds do you want to wait each time before you

1377
00:53:18,161 --> 00:53:19,893
call this method again?

1378
00:53:19,895 --> 00:53:22,462
The target is, who you gonna send the message to?

1379
00:53:22,464 --> 00:53:24,831
It can be any object.

1380
00:53:24,833 --> 00:53:27,867
Okay?

1381
00:53:27,868 --> 00:53:30,902
Remember, any object is not a struct or an enum.

1382
00:53:30,905 --> 00:53:36,008
Although, things like string and number, those are.

1383
00:53:36,010 --> 00:53:38,209
You're not gonna solve puzzles anyway but

1384
00:53:38,211 --> 00:53:40,878
those are essentially any object because they're

1385
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:42,346
bridging over to NS String.

1386
00:53:42,348 --> 00:53:44,715
But anyway, any object, okay, is any object,

1387
00:53:44,717 --> 00:53:47,984
any class basically, and then selector is just

1388
00:53:47,986 --> 00:53:52,255
the method to call when the timer goes off.

1389
00:53:52,257 --> 00:53:54,924
User info is just like a cookie that you can

1390
00:53:54,926 --> 00:53:57,493
hand off here and then every time it fires you'll be giving

1391
00:53:57,495 --> 00:53:58,860
that thing back.

1392
00:53:58,862 --> 00:54:01,429
So, it's just kind of a way of passing this argument off

1393
00:54:01,431 --> 00:54:04,332
to your, so you don't have to keep it in a class,

1394
00:54:04,334 --> 00:54:06,100
in a variable in your class or anything like that.

1395
00:54:06,102 --> 00:54:07,334
You can just hand it off.

1396
00:54:07,336 --> 00:54:09,703
It's like context for the timer.

1397
00:54:09,705 --> 00:54:13,239
And then repeat is whether this thing just does it once,

1398
00:54:13,241 --> 00:54:16,442
or it keeps doing it every however many seconds.

1399
00:54:16,444 --> 00:54:19,111
Is it a repeating timer, or is it just a one time

1400
00:54:19,113 --> 00:54:22,348
do something in the future, and I showed you a way to do

1401
00:54:22,350 --> 00:54:25,450
one time thing in the future with dispatch last time, so

1402
00:54:25,452 --> 00:54:27,552
this will be another way to do something once.

1403
00:54:29,389 --> 00:54:30,788
Here's an example of calling it.

1404
00:54:30,790 --> 00:54:32,289
So here I have a timer.

1405
00:54:32,291 --> 00:54:34,157
It's gonna go off every two seconds.

1406
00:54:34,159 --> 00:54:37,126
It's gonna send this message to myself called fire.

1407
00:54:37,128 --> 00:54:40,296
Notice that, that method can be any name you want,

1408
00:54:40,298 --> 00:54:42,197
except it has to have a colon there,

1409
00:54:42,199 --> 00:54:44,499
because it's going to have an argument.

1410
00:54:44,501 --> 00:54:46,434
I told you that when you're specifying the name of

1411
00:54:46,436 --> 00:54:48,936
a method, if it has an argument,

1412
00:54:48,938 --> 00:54:50,237
you have to put a colon on the end.

1413
00:54:51,407 --> 00:54:52,773
OK. Otherwise it

1414
00:54:52,775 --> 00:54:56,609
thinks it's the method fire without an argument.

1415
00:54:56,611 --> 00:54:58,678
And then userInfo on passing nil.

1416
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:00,713
I don't really want any information,

1417
00:55:00,715 --> 00:55:03,682
I could pass anything, any object I wanted there.

1418
00:55:03,684 --> 00:55:05,583
And then repeats equals true means it's going to fire

1419
00:55:05,585 --> 00:55:06,918
every two seconds.

1420
00:55:06,919 --> 00:55:08,252
It's going to fire in two seconds from now, and

1421
00:55:08,254 --> 00:55:10,054
two seconds after that, and two seconds after that.

1422
00:55:11,290 --> 00:55:14,658
Repeat it forever until I invalidate it, okay?

1423
00:55:14,660 --> 00:55:17,627
So let's look now at the fire timer thing.

1424
00:55:17,629 --> 00:55:19,162
It looks like this.

1425
00:55:19,164 --> 00:55:22,665
You can basically do whatever you want in there.

1426
00:55:22,667 --> 00:55:24,033
You're on the main queue so

1427
00:55:24,035 --> 00:55:26,368
you can do UI in here or whatever.

1428
00:55:26,370 --> 00:55:28,436
If you pass some user info, you can get it

1429
00:55:28,438 --> 00:55:32,006
out of the timer by saying the timer.userinfo.

1430
00:55:32,008 --> 00:55:35,309
Now you've got that info.

1431
00:55:35,311 --> 00:55:36,811
Okay?

1432
00:55:36,812 --> 00:55:38,312
Super simple to use these timers.

1433
00:55:38,314 --> 00:55:40,480
If you wanna stop a timer that's repeating,

1434
00:55:40,482 --> 00:55:42,215
it's going off every two seconds and you wanna stop it,

1435
00:55:42,217 --> 00:55:43,850
you just send it the message, invalidate.

1436
00:55:43,852 --> 00:55:47,119
If you say timer.invalidate, it will stop.

1437
00:55:48,822 --> 00:55:49,387
Okay?

1438
00:55:49,389 --> 00:55:52,924
Another thing you can do to make your system perform

1439
00:55:52,926 --> 00:55:54,692
better is put a tolerance in there.

1440
00:55:54,694 --> 00:55:57,394
What a tolerance says, is if my two, if I'm

1441
00:55:57,396 --> 00:56:00,997
setting something to go off every two minutes let's say.

1442
00:56:00,999 --> 00:56:02,832
Okay?

1443
00:56:02,833 --> 00:56:04,666
When the two minutes is up do I have to do it right away?

1444
00:56:04,669 --> 00:56:07,103
Or can I wait five or ten seconds?

1445
00:56:07,105 --> 00:56:08,871
If you let the system wait five or

1446
00:56:08,873 --> 00:56:12,007
ten seconds, it could pick an optimal time to call your,

1447
00:56:12,009 --> 00:56:15,276
a more optimal time, anyway, to call your timer.

1448
00:56:15,278 --> 00:56:18,846
So, my strong recommendation is, try to give a tolerance.

1449
00:56:18,848 --> 00:56:20,815
A tolerance is just a number of seconds that you're

1450
00:56:20,817 --> 00:56:22,850
willing to wait after it would normally fire.

1451
00:56:22,852 --> 00:56:26,920
Try to give a tolerance of like maybe 10% of your timer.

1452
00:56:26,922 --> 00:56:28,354
So if you have a two second timer,

1453
00:56:28,356 --> 00:56:29,855
give it a tolerance of 0.2 seconds or

1454
00:56:29,857 --> 00:56:32,741
something like that.

1455
00:56:32,742 --> 00:56:35,626
It'll let the system pick a more efficient time to run.

1456
00:56:35,629 --> 00:56:40,298
Like, for example, if your app, we didn't

1457
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:43,801
really explain how this works, but your device can kind of

1458
00:56:43,803 --> 00:56:46,270
go to sleep a little bit when nothing's happening.

1459
00:56:46,272 --> 00:56:49,139
Nothing's drawing on screen, no network activity.

1460
00:56:49,141 --> 00:56:51,941
So it can kind of go into a little lower power state, and

1461
00:56:51,943 --> 00:56:54,410
then it comes back awake every once in awhile.

1462
00:56:54,412 --> 00:56:56,545
Well, if you give it a little tolerant,

1463
00:56:56,547 --> 00:56:59,148
it might be able to kind of go into that low power state and

1464
00:56:59,150 --> 00:57:01,883
then come back up in that little window.

1465
00:57:01,885 --> 00:57:03,969
But if you don't give it a tolerance,

1466
00:57:03,970 --> 00:57:06,054
it might have to stay awake to make sure it hits that timer,

1467
00:57:06,056 --> 00:57:06,754
the one you wanted.

1468
00:57:06,756 --> 00:57:08,222
You see?

1469
00:57:08,223 --> 00:57:09,689
So the tolerance is exactly what it sounds like.

1470
00:57:09,692 --> 00:57:12,760
A little bit of tolerance, give the system a little

1471
00:57:12,762 --> 00:57:15,862
better chance to manage your battery and all that.

1472
00:57:15,864 --> 00:57:17,964
Okay?

1473
00:57:17,966 --> 00:57:20,633
If you give it tolerance, it's not going to drift.

1474
00:57:20,635 --> 00:57:23,302
In other words, if you give a tolerance 2 minute timer and

1475
00:57:23,304 --> 00:57:24,970
you let it go an extra 10 seconds and

1476
00:57:24,972 --> 00:57:27,539
it waits an extra 8 seconds, the next one is not going to

1477
00:57:27,541 --> 00:57:29,874
be 2 minutes after that 2 minutes and 8 seconds.

1478
00:57:29,876 --> 00:57:31,776
It's still going to be 2 minutes after the first

1479
00:57:31,778 --> 00:57:32,677
2 minutes.

1480
00:57:32,678 --> 00:57:33,577
Do you see what I'm saying?

1481
00:57:33,579 --> 00:57:35,596
Within the tolerance.

1482
00:57:35,597 --> 00:57:37,614
So it's going to stay on a schedule of every two minutes,

1483
00:57:37,616 --> 00:57:40,183
even if it waits a little bit on one or two or three.

1484
00:57:40,185 --> 00:57:40,884
It doesn't drift.

1485
00:57:43,088 --> 00:57:43,819
Okay, that's timer.

1486
00:57:45,256 --> 00:57:46,822
Okay. Any questions about that?

1487
00:57:46,824 --> 00:57:49,791
It's a pretty cool little guy.

1488
00:57:49,793 --> 00:57:50,425
All right.

1489
00:57:50,427 --> 00:57:52,177
Animation.

1490
00:57:52,178 --> 00:57:53,928
So, this is kind of Intro to Animation,

1491
00:57:53,930 --> 00:57:55,796
this last ten minutes of today's lecture.

1492
00:57:57,599 --> 00:58:01,367
So, let me talk a little bit about the kinds of animation

1493
00:58:01,369 --> 00:58:02,902
that you can do in iOS.

1494
00:58:02,904 --> 00:58:06,271
One is to animate the properties of a view.

1495
00:58:06,273 --> 00:58:08,573
And that's what we're going to talk about today.

1496
00:58:08,575 --> 00:58:09,941
So that's one kind of animation.

1497
00:58:10,977 --> 00:58:14,378
Another one is animation of view controller transitions,

1498
00:58:14,380 --> 00:58:16,246
like in a navigation controller,

1499
00:58:16,248 --> 00:58:19,449
when you transition to the next card on the stack or

1500
00:58:19,451 --> 00:58:20,767
something like that.

1501
00:58:20,768 --> 00:58:22,084
Or even a modal view controller like the UI alert,

1502
00:58:22,087 --> 00:58:24,620
or the action sheet that slides up from the bottom.

1503
00:58:24,622 --> 00:58:26,856
Okay, that's another kind of animation, obviously.

1504
00:58:26,858 --> 00:58:29,158
Okay we're not going to talk about view controller

1505
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:30,859
transition animation in this class.

1506
00:58:30,861 --> 00:58:33,028
It's not really that terribly difficult, but

1507
00:58:33,030 --> 00:58:35,363
it's just like I got to pick things to talk about and

1508
00:58:35,365 --> 00:58:37,665
that one, we're not going to talk about, okay?

1509
00:58:37,667 --> 00:58:41,068
But there is infrastructure for doing that.

1510
00:58:41,070 --> 00:58:43,670
There's also something called Core Animation.

1511
00:58:43,672 --> 00:58:46,773
Okay, Core Animation is this incredibly powerful animation

1512
00:58:46,775 --> 00:58:49,375
engine that underlies

1513
00:58:49,377 --> 00:58:52,144
all of this UIView animation that's going on.

1514
00:58:53,214 --> 00:58:56,915
And Core Animation can animate arbitrary properties

1515
00:58:56,917 --> 00:58:57,749
over time.

1516
00:58:57,751 --> 00:59:00,117
And it knows how to juggle them and

1517
00:59:00,119 --> 00:59:03,454
knows how to present them on screen over time.

1518
00:59:03,456 --> 00:59:04,888
It's really super powerful.

1519
00:59:04,890 --> 00:59:06,222
Unfortunately, I can't talk about that either.

1520
00:59:06,224 --> 00:59:08,224
Okay. Don't have time for that.

1521
00:59:08,226 --> 00:59:10,826
But if you're going to do something serious animation

1522
00:59:10,828 --> 00:59:13,796
inside views and you're not going to use the next kind I'm

1523
00:59:13,798 --> 00:59:16,365
going to talk about, Core Animation, know that it's

1524
00:59:16,367 --> 00:59:19,367
there because you will eventually have to learn it.

1525
00:59:19,369 --> 00:59:19,934
Okay.

1526
00:59:20,970 --> 00:59:23,504
And the last one's called dynamic animation.

1527
00:59:23,506 --> 00:59:26,039
That's physics-based animation.

1528
00:59:26,041 --> 00:59:30,643
So that's giving views gravity and collision boundaries and

1529
00:59:30,645 --> 00:59:34,279
other behaviors like friction and density, and

1530
00:59:34,281 --> 00:59:35,714
then saying, go.

1531
00:59:35,716 --> 00:59:36,965
Okay? And

1532
00:59:36,966 --> 00:59:38,215
then they'll just behave, okay.

1533
00:59:38,218 --> 00:59:41,252
So that's dynamic behavior based animation, and

1534
00:59:41,254 --> 00:59:43,320
that's what we're going to talk about on Wednesday.

1535
00:59:43,322 --> 00:59:44,621
And that's what your assignment five is

1536
00:59:44,623 --> 00:59:45,689
mostly going to be about.

1537
00:59:45,691 --> 00:59:47,524
Assignment five's going to do a little bit of

1538
00:59:47,526 --> 00:59:49,959
view animation, which I'm going to talk about today, and

1539
00:59:49,961 --> 00:59:51,360
then a lot of dynamic animation.

1540
00:59:51,362 --> 00:59:52,578
Okay?

1541
00:59:52,579 --> 00:59:53,795
And why do we have dynamic animation?

1542
00:59:53,798 --> 00:59:55,597
Why do we have this physics thing?

1543
00:59:55,599 --> 00:59:59,867
If you ever watch an iPhone app, you know,

1544
00:59:59,869 --> 01:00:04,238
if you flip things up and let them drop down.

1545
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:06,873
Don't do it now, but if you get your iPhones out and

1546
01:00:06,875 --> 01:00:09,509
you go to the very front, even if it's locked, and

1547
01:00:09,511 --> 01:00:12,145
you pull down your notifications, you'll notice

1548
01:00:12,147 --> 01:00:15,681
they will kind of hit the bottom and bounce a little.

1549
01:00:15,683 --> 01:00:16,949
Okay?

1550
01:00:16,950 --> 01:00:18,216
It won't just kind of pull it down and

1551
01:00:18,218 --> 01:00:20,118
it won't just go clunk, it goes boom.

1552
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:20,918
Okay? It kind of gives

1553
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:21,919
a soft landing.

1554
01:00:21,921 --> 01:00:23,520
And that kind of animation turns out to

1555
01:00:23,522 --> 01:00:25,756
be surprisingly important for the user experience.

1556
01:00:25,758 --> 01:00:28,224
It makes the user feel a little more like oh, yeah,

1557
01:00:28,226 --> 01:00:30,927
it's kind of giving a constant warm fuzzy feeling about

1558
01:00:30,929 --> 01:00:33,863
what's going on, as opposed to feeling like a computer that

1559
01:00:33,865 --> 01:00:36,398
is slamming things around, okay.

1560
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:38,500
So, dynamic animation is really important for

1561
01:00:38,502 --> 01:00:42,770
giving that really kind of homey feel to your UI.

1562
01:00:42,772 --> 01:00:44,071
Warm feel, okay?

1563
01:00:44,073 --> 01:00:46,840
So that's why we spend a lecture on it next time.

1564
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:50,343
All right, so let's talk about animating view properties.

1565
01:00:50,345 --> 01:00:54,080
Only certain properties can be animated at the UIView level.

1566
01:00:54,082 --> 01:00:55,915
If you go down to Core Animation, you can do more,

1567
01:00:55,917 --> 01:00:57,349
but at UIView level,

1568
01:00:57,351 --> 01:01:00,686
you can really, the three that are most important to animate

1569
01:01:00,688 --> 01:01:04,322
are the frame, that means moving your view around.

1570
01:01:04,324 --> 01:01:07,558
The transform, that means rotating your view or

1571
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:10,127
scaling it in and out.

1572
01:01:10,129 --> 01:01:12,529
And the opacity, the alpha.

1573
01:01:12,531 --> 01:01:14,298
Okay.

1574
01:01:14,299 --> 01:01:16,066
So you can use this kind of animation to

1575
01:01:16,068 --> 01:01:20,803
fade things out using the alpha or to move around,

1576
01:01:20,805 --> 01:01:22,938
although they won't move with this nice physics base.

1577
01:01:22,940 --> 01:01:25,207
So I kind of recommend the dynamic animation for

1578
01:01:25,209 --> 01:01:27,242
moving things.

1579
01:01:27,243 --> 01:01:29,276
But it's really nice for alpha for fading things around, or

1580
01:01:29,279 --> 01:01:30,812
if you're going to have rotating views,

1581
01:01:30,814 --> 01:01:31,813
views that rotate.

1582
01:01:33,783 --> 01:01:37,484
So how do we do this animation with these properties?

1583
01:01:37,486 --> 01:01:42,322
It's done with class methods on UIView and closures, okay?

1584
01:01:42,324 --> 01:01:43,456
So you have this class method.

1585
01:01:43,458 --> 01:01:46,559
You basically say what kind of animation you want,

1586
01:01:46,561 --> 01:01:48,360
how long you want it to take, things like that.

1587
01:01:48,362 --> 01:01:49,995
And then you just provide a closure, and

1588
01:01:49,997 --> 01:01:52,464
inside that closure you change these properties, frame,

1589
01:01:52,466 --> 01:01:53,731
transform, alpha.

1590
01:01:53,733 --> 01:01:55,066
Just change them.

1591
01:01:55,068 --> 01:01:55,766
Okay?

1592
01:01:55,768 --> 01:01:56,800
And then the system

1593
01:01:56,802 --> 01:01:59,002
will animate those changes over time.

1594
01:01:59,004 --> 01:02:00,203
Simple as that.

1595
01:02:00,205 --> 01:02:01,570
So here's what the method looks like.

1596
01:02:01,572 --> 01:02:02,871
It's called animateWithDuration.

1597
01:02:02,873 --> 01:02:04,439
There's a few different kinds of it, but

1598
01:02:04,441 --> 01:02:05,740
this is the basic one.

1599
01:02:05,742 --> 01:02:07,008
You can see that it takes a duration.

1600
01:02:07,010 --> 01:02:08,809
That's how long the animation is going to take.

1601
01:02:08,811 --> 01:02:09,943
A delay is wait.

1602
01:02:09,945 --> 01:02:12,079
Should I wait to start this animation?

1603
01:02:12,081 --> 01:02:14,080
Options, we'll talk about those later.

1604
01:02:14,082 --> 01:02:16,516
Then the block, okay?

1605
01:02:16,518 --> 01:02:19,518
Takes no arguments, returns no arguments there, that closure.

1606
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:23,022
That's where you're going to change those view properties.

1607
01:02:23,024 --> 01:02:25,257
And it also has a completion closure.

1608
01:02:25,259 --> 01:02:27,525
When it's done animating, the animation actually completed,

1609
01:02:27,527 --> 01:02:29,260
it will call this and it'll let you know whether

1610
01:02:29,262 --> 01:02:31,562
the animation finished or whether it was interrupted by

1611
01:02:31,564 --> 01:02:34,965
another animation that tried to change that same property.

1612
01:02:34,967 --> 01:02:38,268
Okay, because you can have multiple animations going off

1613
01:02:38,270 --> 01:02:39,269
at the same time.

1614
01:02:39,271 --> 01:02:40,303
All right? So what does it look like to

1615
01:02:40,305 --> 01:02:41,137
call this?

1616
01:02:41,139 --> 01:02:42,338
Here's an example.

1617
01:02:42,340 --> 01:02:45,841
So this is going to, two seconds from now,

1618
01:02:45,843 --> 01:02:48,710
start fading my view out over three seconds.

1619
01:02:48,712 --> 01:02:50,345
And when it's done fading out,

1620
01:02:50,347 --> 01:02:52,079
it's going to remove it from the super view.

1621
01:02:53,382 --> 01:02:54,748
Okay? That's what this one

1622
01:02:54,750 --> 01:02:56,683
line of code does, okay?

1623
01:02:56,685 --> 01:02:58,551
It's got, I guess it's more than one of code,

1624
01:02:58,553 --> 01:02:59,652
cuz you've got the closures in there.

1625
01:02:59,654 --> 01:03:02,421
But it's what it does, okay?

1626
01:03:02,423 --> 01:03:06,024
So you can see here that I say I want three seconds, for

1627
01:03:06,026 --> 01:03:06,958
it to take three seconds, but

1628
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:08,159
I want it to start in two seconds, so

1629
01:03:08,161 --> 01:03:09,527
you're going to take five seconds total.

1630
01:03:09,529 --> 01:03:11,962
Okay, it's not going to do anything for the first two.

1631
01:03:11,964 --> 01:03:13,764
And then in my block, I just change my alpha.

1632
01:03:14,866 --> 01:03:16,766
Right? From 1, which it started out,

1633
01:03:16,768 --> 01:03:20,502
I have an if that says only do this if I'm fully opaque.

1634
01:03:20,504 --> 01:03:21,470
So I just set it to zero.

1635
01:03:21,472 --> 01:03:23,388
That's all I have to do.

1636
01:03:23,389 --> 01:03:25,305
And then in my completion block, if I finished,

1637
01:03:25,308 --> 01:03:28,209
that's the if $0, that's the finish thing.

1638
01:03:28,211 --> 01:03:29,360
If I finish,

1639
01:03:29,361 --> 01:03:30,510
then I'm going to remove myself from the super view.

1640
01:03:30,513 --> 01:03:33,580
But if someone else animated alpha in between,

1641
01:03:33,582 --> 01:03:35,248
then I'm not going to remove myself from super view.

1642
01:03:35,250 --> 01:03:36,616
Which makes sense, right?

1643
01:03:36,617 --> 01:03:37,983
Because they probably changed the alpha to something

1644
01:03:37,986 --> 01:03:40,253
nonzero, okay?

1645
01:03:40,255 --> 01:03:42,922
Now, a very important thing to understand about animation,

1646
01:03:42,924 --> 01:03:46,258
all animation that's going on, is when you make changes,

1647
01:03:46,260 --> 01:03:48,460
they happen immediately.

1648
01:03:48,462 --> 01:03:52,296
The animation is just showing it to the user over time.

1649
01:03:52,298 --> 01:03:54,031
Okay? So in this code,

1650
01:03:54,033 --> 01:03:58,402
when I print myView.alpha equals myView.alpha,

1651
01:03:58,404 --> 01:04:03,239
that is going to print zero, because that closure changed

1652
01:04:03,241 --> 01:04:06,242
it to zero and it does it right away.

1653
01:04:06,244 --> 01:04:07,976
Okay. Even though the user doesn't

1654
01:04:07,978 --> 01:04:09,711
get to see it on screen for five seconds,

1655
01:04:09,713 --> 01:04:11,380
that's irrelevant.

1656
01:04:11,381 --> 01:04:13,048
The fact is, I just changed my alpha to zero.

1657
01:04:14,451 --> 01:04:16,317
Okay. It's very important to

1658
01:04:16,318 --> 01:04:18,184
understand and it will take some wrapping your head around

1659
01:04:18,187 --> 01:04:20,187
until you really understand and work with it.

1660
01:04:20,189 --> 01:04:22,989
But it's a little bit like multithreaded programming to

1661
01:04:22,991 --> 01:04:23,690
understand.

1662
01:04:23,692 --> 01:04:25,759
But really,

1663
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:27,827
all animation is presenting it to the user over time.

1664
01:04:27,829 --> 01:04:29,128
It's not changing it over time.

1665
01:04:30,598 --> 01:04:33,732
Okay? All right.

1666
01:04:33,734 --> 01:04:34,566
So that's it.

1667
01:04:34,568 --> 01:04:36,567
That's how view animation works.

1668
01:04:36,569 --> 01:04:37,435
Here's all the options.

1669
01:04:37,437 --> 01:04:38,702
There's billions of them here.

1670
01:04:39,738 --> 01:04:41,071
You can change the curve.

1671
01:04:41,073 --> 01:04:44,807
So CurseEaseInEaseOut means that it starts slowly and

1672
01:04:44,809 --> 01:04:47,510
then speeds up to normal and then slows back down again.

1673
01:04:47,512 --> 01:04:48,811
So my fade, that's the way it worked.

1674
01:04:48,813 --> 01:04:50,412
It would start fading out slowly and

1675
01:04:50,414 --> 01:04:53,048
then normal speed and then at the very end when it's fading

1676
01:04:53,050 --> 01:04:54,549
out, fade out a little slower.

1677
01:04:54,551 --> 01:04:56,050
Okay?

1678
01:04:56,052 --> 01:04:57,351
You can also,

1679
01:04:57,352 --> 01:04:58,651
I don't have time to show you all these things, but

1680
01:04:58,654 --> 01:05:00,387
you can look at all these things.

1681
01:05:00,388 --> 01:05:02,121
BeginFromCurrentState is an interesting one because I just

1682
01:05:02,124 --> 01:05:05,458
told you that the change happens immediately.

1683
01:05:05,460 --> 01:05:08,361
But if you issued another animation that changed

1684
01:05:08,363 --> 01:05:11,464
the alpha and you had this BeginFromCurrentState on,

1685
01:05:11,466 --> 01:05:14,966
then that animation would pick up wherever any other

1686
01:05:14,968 --> 01:05:16,067
animation is.

1687
01:05:16,069 --> 01:05:18,202
So that other animation might be partway

1688
01:05:18,204 --> 01:05:19,604
through doing the alpha.

1689
01:05:19,605 --> 01:05:21,005
And then I do another animation with this

1690
01:05:21,007 --> 01:05:23,307
BeginFromCurrentState and it's not going to start with it

1691
01:05:23,309 --> 01:05:25,442
at zero, which is what alpha is now.

1692
01:05:25,444 --> 01:05:28,645
It's going to pick up the partial, okay?

1693
01:05:28,647 --> 01:05:31,381
So that's one way where you can actually kind of over time

1694
01:05:31,383 --> 01:05:33,282
get the value, by issuing another animation.

1695
01:05:35,286 --> 01:05:37,285
Remember, all these animations are happening in another

1696
01:05:37,287 --> 01:05:38,720
thread off the main queue.

1697
01:05:38,722 --> 01:05:42,656
They're all happening out of time for you, okay?

1698
01:05:42,658 --> 01:05:44,892
When you send that last line of code,

1699
01:05:44,894 --> 01:05:47,127
alpha immediately went to zero and you're on your way.

1700
01:05:47,129 --> 01:05:48,996
Your code is still going.

1701
01:05:48,997 --> 01:05:50,864
The fact that things are happening on screen over time,

1702
01:05:50,866 --> 01:05:53,933
it's kind of not relevant to you.

1703
01:05:53,935 --> 01:05:55,167
It's relevant to your user though.

1704
01:05:56,337 --> 01:05:56,902
Okay?

1705
01:05:58,605 --> 01:06:01,406
Sometimes you want to change an entire view and

1706
01:06:01,408 --> 01:06:03,674
you can do that as well.

1707
01:06:03,676 --> 01:06:07,144
I'll give you an example here of a playing card.

1708
01:06:07,146 --> 01:06:09,346
So if I had a playing card that has a back and a front.

1709
01:06:09,348 --> 01:06:11,781
I might want to flip that card over.

1710
01:06:11,783 --> 01:06:13,416
Okay, so I wanna change everything in the view.

1711
01:06:13,418 --> 01:06:15,351
I wanna redraw the view basically, but

1712
01:06:15,353 --> 01:06:16,385
I want it to flip over.

1713
01:06:16,387 --> 01:06:18,320
I don't want it to just boop change,

1714
01:06:18,322 --> 01:06:21,489
I want it to have an animation where it flips over.

1715
01:06:21,491 --> 01:06:24,392
So you can do flips over and curls up and dissolves, okay,

1716
01:06:24,394 --> 01:06:26,294
you can do all those.

1717
01:06:26,295 --> 01:06:28,195
The way you do that is with a different UIView class

1718
01:06:28,197 --> 01:06:30,297
method called transitionWithView.

1719
01:06:30,299 --> 01:06:32,966
You just give it the view, the playing card view or whatever.

1720
01:06:32,968 --> 01:06:35,068
You tell how long you want the animation to take.

1721
01:06:35,070 --> 01:06:37,470
What kind of thing you want like flipping or

1722
01:06:37,472 --> 01:06:38,804
dissolving or whatever.

1723
01:06:38,806 --> 01:06:39,905
You give it the animation.

1724
01:06:39,907 --> 01:06:42,507
Inside that animation you're changing your view,

1725
01:06:42,509 --> 01:06:44,109
changing the attributes in your view.

1726
01:06:44,111 --> 01:06:45,810
Like, if you had your calculator and

1727
01:06:45,812 --> 01:06:49,647
you wanted to change from one graph to another.

1728
01:06:49,649 --> 01:06:51,181
In here you would change the graph.

1729
01:06:51,183 --> 01:06:53,817
Okay, you would change it so when it draws the next time,

1730
01:06:53,819 --> 01:06:55,285
we draw something different.

1731
01:06:55,287 --> 01:06:58,788
And then it would animate it, dissolve it, or whatever and

1732
01:06:58,790 --> 01:07:00,589
show the new version.

1733
01:07:00,591 --> 01:07:02,491
In this closure you're changing anything you want

1734
01:07:02,493 --> 01:07:05,494
about the view, any attributes, any properties.

1735
01:07:05,496 --> 01:07:08,363
So the next time it draws, it will draw differently and

1736
01:07:08,365 --> 01:07:11,632
then this animation will kind of interpolate between those

1737
01:07:11,634 --> 01:07:14,502
two states, doing a flip or dissolve or whatever.

1738
01:07:14,504 --> 01:07:15,969
So that's another kind of thing.

1739
01:07:15,971 --> 01:07:17,204
Now this one you're probably going to be

1740
01:07:17,206 --> 01:07:18,772
doing in your homework.

1741
01:07:18,774 --> 01:07:21,607
Okay, I think I asked you explicitly to do some sort of

1742
01:07:21,609 --> 01:07:23,075
animation like this.

1743
01:07:24,512 --> 01:07:26,845
Either this one or the last one, either one.

1744
01:07:26,847 --> 01:07:28,480
So yeah, here's the playing card example.

1745
01:07:28,482 --> 01:07:31,282
You can see in the closure I'm just changing the card to

1746
01:07:31,284 --> 01:07:32,166
be face up.

1747
01:07:32,167 --> 01:07:33,049
And so the next time it draws,

1748
01:07:33,052 --> 01:07:34,184
it's going to draw differently.

1749
01:07:35,187 --> 01:07:36,219
Okay?

1750
01:07:36,220 --> 01:07:37,252
And again, this happens immediately.

1751
01:07:37,255 --> 01:07:39,856
That card is face up equals not card is face up.

1752
01:07:39,858 --> 01:07:40,756
That happens instantly,

1753
01:07:40,758 --> 01:07:42,858
as soon as I call this method, okay?

1754
01:07:42,860 --> 01:07:45,494
It's just that over time, on screen, it will happen.

1755
01:07:46,430 --> 01:07:47,695
But it happened immediately, right there.

1756
01:07:47,697 --> 01:07:49,797
If the next line, I say if card is face up,

1757
01:07:49,799 --> 01:07:52,333
it's going to be the changed value, okay?

1758
01:07:52,335 --> 01:07:54,601
These transitionWithView methods,

1759
01:07:54,603 --> 01:07:56,970
animated with duration, they return immediately.

1760
01:07:56,972 --> 01:07:58,104
They do what's in the enclosure and

1761
01:07:58,106 --> 01:07:58,804
return immediately.

1762
01:08:01,709 --> 01:08:02,273
Okay?

1763
01:08:03,810 --> 01:08:05,943
If you're animating changes to the view hierarchy,

1764
01:08:05,945 --> 01:08:07,344
like you're hiding views or

1765
01:08:07,346 --> 01:08:09,546
removing them from super view and that's all you're doing,

1766
01:08:09,548 --> 01:08:11,214
and you want them to flip over and

1767
01:08:11,216 --> 01:08:14,650
go away, then you can use this transitionFromView to view.

1768
01:08:14,652 --> 01:08:15,451
Okay? Otherwise it's

1769
01:08:15,453 --> 01:08:17,270
exactly the same.

1770
01:08:17,271 --> 01:08:19,088
It's just for things that change the view hierarchy but

1771
01:08:19,090 --> 01:08:20,589
it's basically the same.

1772
01:08:20,591 --> 01:08:22,257
So there's no closure there because

1773
01:08:22,259 --> 01:08:24,192
the change you're making is change in the view hierarchy.

1774
01:08:24,194 --> 01:08:25,526
You're not changing card that's face up,

1775
01:08:25,528 --> 01:08:27,428
you're actually changing whether the view is

1776
01:08:27,430 --> 01:08:28,695
in the hierarchy anymore.

1777
01:08:30,365 --> 01:08:32,965
Yeah. >> I'm just wondering, so.

1778
01:08:32,967 --> 01:08:35,935
If you want to specify several of the [INAUDIBLE].

1779
01:08:35,937 --> 01:08:37,469
>> Yeah.

1780
01:08:37,471 --> 01:08:39,371
>> [INAUDIBLE].

1781
01:08:39,373 --> 01:08:43,007
>> Yeah.

1782
01:08:43,009 --> 01:08:46,344
>> No, they are.

1783
01:08:46,346 --> 01:08:48,779
That's a good question in this particular API.

1784
01:08:48,781 --> 01:08:51,281
Ask me on Piazza and I'll try and

1785
01:08:51,283 --> 01:08:55,351
some APIs you specify as an array, some APIs different.

1786
01:08:55,353 --> 01:08:57,720
It depends but most times, Swift is an eNom,

1787
01:08:57,722 --> 01:09:01,123
so you are doing something like that or combining them,

1788
01:09:01,125 --> 01:09:03,625
so ask me on Piazza.

1789
01:09:03,627 --> 01:09:04,292
Okay.

1790
01:09:04,294 --> 01:09:05,426
So that's it for today.

1791
01:09:05,428 --> 01:09:07,078
On Friday,

1792
01:09:07,079 --> 01:09:08,729
we have a great section which is UICollectionView.

1793
01:09:08,731 --> 01:09:11,398
It's great because UICollectionView is very

1794
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:12,599
similar to UITableView.

1795
01:09:12,601 --> 01:09:15,101
You'll really understand UITableView

1796
01:09:15,103 --> 01:09:18,004
if you go do look at this UICollectionView one.

1797
01:09:18,006 --> 01:09:20,172
Monday's a holiday and the next week I'm going to start

1798
01:09:20,174 --> 01:09:21,674
on that physics-based animation.

1799
01:09:21,676 --> 01:09:24,409
>> [COUGH] >> Thank you very much.

1800
01:09:27,313 --> 01:09:27,344
>> For more, please visit us at stanford.edu.
